    "description": "The report generation capability must support on-demand review and analysis in order to facilitate the organization's ability to generate incident reports as needed to better handle larger-scale or more complex security incidents.\n\nReport generation must be capable of generating on-demand (i.e., customizable, ad-hoc, and as-needed) reports. On-demand reporting allows personnel to report issues more rapidly to more effectively meet reporting requirements. Collecting log data and aggregating it to present the data in a single, consolidated report achieves this objective.\n\nAudit reduction and report generation capabilities do not always reside on the same information system or within the same organizational entities conducting auditing activities. The audit reduction capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the information system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the time stamp in the record is insufficient.\n\nThis requirement is specific to applications with report generation capabilities; however, applications need to support on-demand audit review and analysis.",
