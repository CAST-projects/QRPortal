    "description": "The report generation capability must support on-demand reporting in order to facilitate the organization's ability to generate incident reports as needed to better handle larger-scale or more complex security incidents.\n\nThe report generation capability provided by the application must be capable of generating on-demand (i.e., customizable, ad-hoc, and as-needed) reports. On-demand reporting allows personnel to report issues more rapidly to more effectively meet reporting requirements. Collecting log data and aggregating it to present the data in a single, consolidated report achieves this objective.\n\nThis requirement is specific to applications with report generation capabilities; however, applications need to support on-demand reporting requirements.",
