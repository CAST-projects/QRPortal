In addition, on Windows-based Cloud resources, write-access to the registry is generally blocked, including access to any per-user registry keys. From the app\u2019s perspective, write access to the registry should never be relied upon in the Cloud environment since apps can (and do) get migrated across different virtual machines. These application settings should be stored in a Cloud-based and OS-agnostic service.",
