Ideally, stateful sessions should be replaced by stateless and client-side mechanisms such as cookies, client cache (e.g. Redis, memcache\u2026) or in an external cloud-based storage. This is an important architectural constraint of microservices-style applications, as it enables resiliency, elasticity, and allows any available service instance to execute any task.",
