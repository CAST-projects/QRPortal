Without this notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability and system operation may be adversely affected. \n\nAudit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.\n\nThis requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both.",
