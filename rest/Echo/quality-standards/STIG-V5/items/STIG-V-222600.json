(e.g., a web application should not divulge the fact there is a SQL server database and/or its version).\n\nThese events usually occur when the web application has not been configured to send specific error messages for error events. Instead, when a processing anomaly occurs, the application displays technical information about the type of application server, database in use, or other technical details.\n\nThis provides attackers additional information which they can use to find other attack avenues, or tailor specific attacks, on the application.",
