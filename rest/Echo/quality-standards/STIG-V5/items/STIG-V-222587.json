    "description": "Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive and tape drive) within an organizational information system. Mobile devices, laptops, desktops, and storage devices can be either lost or stolen, and the contents of their data storage (e.g., hard drives and non-volatile memory) can be read, copied, or altered. \n\nApplications and application users generate information throughout the course of their application use, including data that is stored in areas of volatile memory.  Volatile memory must not be overlooked when assigning protections.\n\nThis requirement addresses protection of user-generated data, as well as, operating system-specific configuration data. \n\nApplications must employ mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate, in accordance with the security category and/or classification of the information.\n\nThis can include segmenting and controlling access to the data such as utilizing file permissions to restrict access, using role based controls to restrict access or applying a cryptographic hash to the data and evaluating hash values for changes made to data.",
