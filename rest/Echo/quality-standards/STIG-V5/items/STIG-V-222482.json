In addition, attackers often manipulate logs to hide or obfuscate their activity.\n\nOff-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity or when trying to assure log availability and integrity.\n\nThis requirement is meant to address space limitations and integrity issues that can be encountered when storing logs on the local server.\n\nThe goal of the requirement being to offload application logs to a separate server as quickly and efficiently as possible so as to mitigate these risks.",
