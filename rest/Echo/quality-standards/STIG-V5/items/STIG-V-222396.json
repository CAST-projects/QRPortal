    "description": "Without confidentiality protection mechanisms, unauthorized individuals may gain access to sensitive information via a remote access session.\n\nRemote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.\n\nEncryption provides a means to secure the remote connection to prevent unauthorized access to the data traversing the remote access connection thereby providing a degree of confidentiality. The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information.",
