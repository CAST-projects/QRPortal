    "description": "Failure to protect organizational information from data mining may result in a compromise of information.\n\nData mining occurs when the application is programmatically probed and data is automatically extracted. While there are valid uses for data mining within data sets, the organization should be mindful that adversaries may attempt to use data mining capabilities built into the application in order to completely extract application data so it can be evaluated using methods that are not natively offered by the application. This can provide the adversary with an opportunity to utilize inference attacks or obtain additional insights that might not have been intended when the application was designed.\n\nMethods of extraction include database queries or screen scrapes using the application itself. The entity performing the data mining must have access to the application in order to extract the data. Data mining attacks will usually occur with publicly releasable data access but can also occur when access is limited to authorized or authenticated inside users.\n\nData storage objects include, for example, databases, database records, and database fields.\n\nData mining prevention and detection techniques include, for example: limiting the types of responses provided to database queries; limiting the number/frequency of database queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of such databases; and notifying organizational personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur.",
