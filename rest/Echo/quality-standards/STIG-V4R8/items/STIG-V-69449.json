    "description": "If security personnel are not notified immediately upon storage volume utilization reaching 75%, they are unable to plan for storage capacity expansion.\n\nDue to variances in application usage and audit records storage usage, the SA and the ISSO may evaluate usage patterns and determine if a higher percentage of usage is warranted before an alarm is sent.  The intent of the requirement is to provide a warning that will allow the SA and ISSO ample time to plan and implement an audit storage capacity expansion that will provide for the increased audit log storage requirements without forcing an emergency or otherwise negatively impacting the recording of audit events.\n\nThe requirement will take into account a reasonable amount of processing time such as 1 or 2 minutes that may be required of the system in order to satisfy the requirement.",
