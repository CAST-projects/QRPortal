Attempts to modify a security level can be construed as an attempt to change the configuration of the application so as to create a new security role or modify an existing security role. Some applications may or may not provide this capability.\n\nWithout generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident, or identify those responsible for one.\n\nAudit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).",
