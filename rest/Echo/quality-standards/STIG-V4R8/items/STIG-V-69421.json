Applications must provide a record of their actions so application events can be investigated post-event.  \n\nAttackers may attempt to shut off the application logging capability to cover their activity while on the system.  Recording the shutdown event and the time it occurred in the application or  system logs helps to provide forensic evidence that aids in investigating the events.",
