These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured.

Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).\n\nExamples of non-essential capabilities include, but are not limited to, advertising software or browser plug-ins not related to requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission, but cannot be disabled.",
