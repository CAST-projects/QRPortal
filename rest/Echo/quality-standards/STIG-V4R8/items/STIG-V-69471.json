This capability is also required to comply with applicable Federal laws and DoD policies.\n\nThe report generation capability must support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents either natively or through the use of third-party tools.\n\nThis requirement is specific to applications with report generation capabilities; however, applications need to support on-demand reporting requirements.",
