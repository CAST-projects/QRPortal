Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events.\n\nIf the internal clock is not used, the system may not be able to provide time stamps for log messages. Additionally, externally generated time stamps may not be accurate. Applications can use the capability of an operating system or purpose-built module for this purpose.",
