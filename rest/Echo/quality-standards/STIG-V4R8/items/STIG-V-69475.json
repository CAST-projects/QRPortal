Time ordering refers to the chronological organization of records based on time stamps. The degree of time stamp precision can affect this.\n\nThe report generation capability provided by the application can generate customizable reports.\n\nThis requirement is specific to applications with audit reduction capabilities; however, applications need to support on-demand audit review and analysis.",
