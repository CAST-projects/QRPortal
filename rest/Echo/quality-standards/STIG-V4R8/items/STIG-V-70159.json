    "description": "A cryptographic module is a hardware or software device or component that performs cryptographic operations securely within a physical or logical boundary, using a hardware, software or hybrid cryptographic engine contained within the boundary, and cryptographic keys that do not leave the boundary.\nBased on the criticality of the application, system designers might choose to utilize a hardware based cryptographic module due to the protections and security benefits a hardware based solution provides over a software based solution. Due to various factors, including expense, hardware based encryption modules are usually relegated to only those applications where the system requirements specify it as a required protection. Examples include applications that handle extremely sensitive data or those used in life and death situations, e.g., weapons systems. \nGeneral purpose applications such as a web site will often opt to leverage an underlying software based encryption capability that is offered by the OS, database or application development framework.  Operating systems or database products often provide their own cryptographic modules that are FIPS 140-2 compliant and can meet the authentication to the crypto module requirement via their Role Based Access Controls (users and groups) built into the product.  \nIn all cases, user\u2019s accessing the cryptographic module must be authenticated and granted the appropriate rights in order to access the encryption module.  Any encryption utilized by the access control mechanisms must be FIPS 140-2 compliant.\n",
