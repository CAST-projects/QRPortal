    "description": "A replay attack may enable an unauthorized user to gain access to the application. Authentication sessions between the authenticator and the application validating the user credentials must not be vulnerable to a replay attack.\n\nAn authentication process resists replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message.\n\nA privileged account is any information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.\n\nTechniques used to address this include protocols using nonces (e.g., numbers generated for a specific one time use) or challenges (e.g., TLS, WS_Security). Additional techniques include time-synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.",
