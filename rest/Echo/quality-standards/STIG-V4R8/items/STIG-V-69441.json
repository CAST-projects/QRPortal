This could lead to security compromises such as data misuse, unauthorized changes, or unauthorized access.\n\nTransaction logs contain a sequential record of all changes to the database. Using a transaction log helps with maintaining application availability and aids in speedy recovery. Transactional logging should be enabled whenever the application database offers the transactional logging capability.",
