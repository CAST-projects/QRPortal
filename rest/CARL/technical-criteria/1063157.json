    "description": "Purpose\nNetwork devices and applications have been known to transmit unencrypted, readable authentication factors (such as passwords and passphrases) across the network and/or store these values without encryption. As a result, a malicious individual can easily intercept this information during transmission using a \u201csniffer,\u201d or directly access unencrypted authentication factors in files where they are stored, and then use this data to gain unauthorized access.",
