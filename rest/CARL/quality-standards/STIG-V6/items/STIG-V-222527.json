    "description": "Multifactor authentication (MFA) requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication and access.\n\nFactors include:\n(i) something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);\n(ii) something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or\n(iii) something a user is (e.g., biometric).\n\nMFA decreases the attack surface by virtue of the fact that attackers must obtain two factors, a physical token or a biometric and a PIN, in order to authenticate. It is not enough to simply steal a user's password to obtain access. \n\nA privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.\n\nAn Alt. Token is a separate CAC or token used specifically for administrative account access and serves as a separate identifier much like a separate user account.\n\nLocal access is defined as access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.",
