    "description": "A mechanism to detect and prevent unauthorized communication flow must be configured or provided as part of the system design. If information flow is not enforced based on approved authorizations, the system may become compromised. Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a system and between interconnected systems. The flow of all system information must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the systems or data.\n\nApplication specific examples of enforcement occurs in systems that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).\n\nThis is usually established by identifying if there are rulesets, policies or other configurations settings provided by the application which serve to control the flow of information within the system. Control of data flow is established by using labels on data and data subsets, evaluating the destination of the data within or without the system (similar security domain) and referencing a corresponding policy that is used to control the flow of data.\n\nApplications providing information flow control must be able to enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system in accordance with applicable policy.",
