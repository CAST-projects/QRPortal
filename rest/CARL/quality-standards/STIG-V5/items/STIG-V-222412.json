This creates a security risk as these accounts often remain after the initial installation process and can be used to gain unauthorized access to the application. Applications must be designed and configured to disable or delete any unnecessary accounts that may be created. \n\nCare must be taken to ensure valid accounts used for valid application operations are not disabled or deleted when this requirement is applied.",
