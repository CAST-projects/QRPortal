    "description": "Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised since unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read or altered.\n\nThis requirement applies  to those applications that transmit data, or allow access to data non-locally. Application and data owners have a responsibility for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. \n\nApplication and data owners need to identify the data that requires cryptographic protection. If no data protection requirements are defined as to what specific data must be encrypted and what data is non-sensitive and doesn't require encryption, all data must be encrypted.\n \nWhen transmitting data, applications need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms, such as TLS, SSL VPNs, or IPSEC.\n\nCommunication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.",
