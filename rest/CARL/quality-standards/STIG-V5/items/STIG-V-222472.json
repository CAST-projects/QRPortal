To be able to investigate which account accessed data, the account making the data changes must be logged. Without establishing when the data change event occurred, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident, or identify those responsible for one.\n\nAssociating event types with detected events in the application and audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured application.",
