    "description": "Use strong cryptography and security protocols (for example, TLS, IPSEC, SSH, etc.) to safeguard sensitive cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks, including the following:\n- Only trusted keys and certificates are accepted.\n- The protocol in use only supports secure versions or configurations.\n- The encryption strength is appropriate for the encryption methodology in use.\nNote: SSL and early TLS are not considered strong cryptography and cannot be used as a security control after June 30, 2016. Prior to this date, existing implementations that use SSL and/or early TLS must have a formal Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan in place.\nEffective immediately, new implementations must not use SSL or early TLS.\nPOS POI terminals (and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect) that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early TLS may continue using these as a security control after June 30, 2016.\nExamples of open, public networks include but are not limited to:\n- The Internet\n- Wireless technologies, including 802.11 and Bluetooth\n- Cellular technologies, for example, Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), Code division multiple access (CDMA)\n- General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)\n- Satellite communications",
