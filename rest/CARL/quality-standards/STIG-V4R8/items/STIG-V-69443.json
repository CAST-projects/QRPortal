Centralized management of audit records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as the backup and archiving of those records. Application components requiring centralized audit log management must have the capability to support centralized management.\n\nThis requirement applies to centralized management applications or similar types of applications designed to manage and configure audit record capture.",
