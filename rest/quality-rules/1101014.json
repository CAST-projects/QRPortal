    "rationale": "ANSI syntax allows a clear separation between joins clauses and the where clause restrictions. The ANSI notation makes the relations between the tables explicit, and saves you from coding equality tests for join conditions in the WHERE clause. Support for full outer joins also eliminates the need for complex workarounds to do those queries (with the old syntax some constructions can lead to unexpected behavior). Moreover ANSI joins allows the use of optimization hints.",
