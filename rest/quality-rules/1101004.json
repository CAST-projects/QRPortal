    "description": "This metric retrieves the artifacts with at least one table accessed on non-indexed columns.\nA SQL query is considered indexed when all the following conditions are true:\n\n- At least one index is accessed for each non XXS table\n- the access is on the left-most columns of the indexes\n\nAn XXS table is a table containing an extremely low amount of data. Default is 10. The threshold that determines when a table XXS can be configured by the user in the same manner as for XXL tables.\n",
