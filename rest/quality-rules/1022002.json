This can be identified when literal value starting with RSA/NONE is found in source code\n\nThis rule is compliant with :\n\nCWE-780 - Use of RSA Algorithm without OAEP\nCWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\nOWASP: A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure\n\n   ",
    "output": "This rule reports full name of the java method using RSA encryption algorithm without OAEP.\n  ",
    "rationale": "Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding schemes are often used with cryptographic algorithms to make the plaintext less predictable and complicate attack efforts. The OAEP scheme is often used with RSA to nullify the impact of predictable common text  \n",
