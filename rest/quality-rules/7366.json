    "description": "This rule searches for Cobol programs in which FD clauses defined in the FILE SECTION of the DATA DIVISION are defined without a BLOCK CONTAINS clause or with a value not equal to 0.\n\nNote: VSAM files (identified by the INDEXED clause) and sort files (SD) are not considered as violating the rule.",
