    "description": "This metrics retrieves all tables having indexes with a too large index definition (larger than the threshold parameter). The index definition size is measured as the sum of index column's size in bytes.",
    "output": "This Quality Rule does not report any additional value on the Violation.",
    "rationale": "The wider an index definition, the bigger the index becomes physically, and the more work the database has to perform when accessing or modifying the data. Because of this, you should avoid adding indexes to very wide columns. The narrower the index, the faster it will perform. \n\nYou can't always avoid indexing wide columns or using composite indexes, but if you think you have to use one, be sure you have carefully evaluated your choice and are confident you don't have other options that may offer better performance.",
