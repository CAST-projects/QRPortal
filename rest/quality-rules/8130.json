    "rationale": "Database hints provide a means to bypass the DBMS optimizer by passing additional information directly to the database interface, DBSL or the underlying database system in order to allow these components to optimize certain data access. See SAP Note 1622681 for the supported DBSL hints for SAP HANA. \nHints are specific for one system configuration and its quantity structure. For this reason only use hints in the standard SAP system with caution. \nIt is not recommended to use hard-coded hints for specific databases in your reports, function modules etc.",
