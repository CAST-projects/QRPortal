    "description": "All Action Classes should inherit from a single Class, inheriting from the Struts Action Class (org.apache.struts.action.Action). When a class inherit from an action class, all other action class must inherit from the same one. This base class must be abstract or have an abstract method.",
    "output": "This report lists all Action Classes inheriting from different Class.\nIt provides the following information:\n - Class full name\n - parent Class full name",
    "rationale": "It is a good practice to extend the struts Action class, and all specific Actions should inherit from it. With such inheritance tree, the basic action class (those inheriting from Struts Action class) implements the methods shared by all the Action class to avoid code redundancy.",
