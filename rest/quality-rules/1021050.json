This is why all major browsers support the secure cookie property that prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie. The Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session. This rule is compliant with OWASP 2013 A6 and 2017 A3 - Sensitive Data Exposure.",
