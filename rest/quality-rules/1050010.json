If server trust evaluation is failing, you must understand why it's failing and decide on the best way to resolve that failure.

This inconsistency leads to the risk of exposing data and session IDs to interception. The use of transport security does not mean the app has implemented it correctly. To detect basic flaws, observe the phone's network traffic. More subtle flaws require inspecting the design of the application and the applications configuration."
