    "rationale": "In SQL the UNION operator combines the results of two SQL queries into a single table of all matching rows. The two queries must have matching fields and data types in order to join them.\n Any duplicate records are automatically removed unless UNION ALL is used. \nThe problem is that MOST of the time it is unnecessary to remove duplicate as there are none and doing the search for duplicate rows can be very costly.",

    "sample": "select C1a, C2a\nfrom Table1\nunion  <- Failure here\nselect C1b, C2b\nfrom Table2\n\n=> The database server will read the values, sort them and eliminate duplicates. This is costly and likely to be useless.",
