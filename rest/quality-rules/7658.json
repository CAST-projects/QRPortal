    "description": "This metric retrieves all SQL artifacts that query XXL tables and that use functions on indexed columns in WHERE clause.\nIt retrieves all SQL artifacts  with a WHERE clause using a function that takes a table column used as a database index as a function parameter (except specific indexes such as function-based indexes).\n\nXXL tables are extremely large tables which contain a huge amount of data. The threshold that determines when a table is considered to contain a huge amount of data can be configured by the user.",
    "output": "Associated to each artifact with violations, the Quality Rule provides: \n- Name of the column (first column used as function parameter).",
    "rationale": "Whenever a function is used in a WHERE clause and takes a indexed column as a function parameter, the database engine might be unable to take advantage of the index, leading to very poor performance.",
