    "rationale": "Cartesian joins which lead to cartesian products is an absolute performance killer, especially when large data sets are involved.  A cartesian join is a multiple-table query that does not explicitly state a join condition among the tables, it creates a Cartesian product. A Cartesian product consists of every possible combination of rows from the tables. This result set is usually extremely large and unwieldy, killing application performance.\nIn addition, most of the time, this is also a functional bug.",
