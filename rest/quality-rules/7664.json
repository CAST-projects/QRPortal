    "description": "This rule retrieves all ABAP artifacts using FOR ALL ENTRIES IN statement without explicitly checking the emptiness of the internal table used in the FOR ALL ENTRIES IN statement. This metric applies only to extremely large database tables (XXL tables).\nThe emptiness checks recognized are the following \nCHECK NOT ts_table[] IS INITIAL.\nIF NOT ts_table[] IS INITIAL.\n\nXXL tables are extremely large tables which contain a huge amount of data. The threshold that determines when a table is considered to contain a huge amount of data can be configured by the user.",
    "output": "Associated to each ABAP Artifact with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The XXL SAP Table/View name",
    "rationale": "As the FOR ALL ENTRIES IN is part of the WHERE clause, an empty internal table can end-up in a full table scan and thus cause very important performance troubles as this metric applies only to extremely large tables (XXL tables). This is why it is mandatory to include an  emptiness check before any use of the FOR ALL ENTRIES IN statement.",
