    "description": "This rule searches for C++ functions that contain C-style casts or static_casts from a pointer to a derived class to a pointer to one of its base classes.",
    "output": "Associated to each C++ constructor, destructor, or method with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- Number of violation patterns\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in the source code:\n  - cast between derived and base classes\n  - derived class declaration\n  - base class declaration",
    "rationale": "Casting from a derived class to a base class is implicit. If you explicitly write a cast, it will work too, but it will also work in a situation where it should not, for instance if the class hierarchy has changed.\n\nRelying on implicit casting is therefore both simpler to use and safer.",
    "remediation": "Following the example, if A and B were not related in any way, line 1 would still compile (and be equivalent to reinterpret_cast), but would be wrong, see rule \"Never perform C-style cast between incompatible Class pointers\" (id 8002).\nIf A and B were related, but B not be derived from A, line 1 and 2 would still compile, but would be wrong. See rule \"A pointer to a base Class shall only be cast to a pointer to a derived Class by means of 'dynamic_cast'\" (id 8060).",
