    "description": "This rule searches for C++ operators that are overloaded. The list of operators that are checked is as follows:\n- ampersand ('&')\n- comma (',')\n- logical AND ('&&')\n- logical OR ('||')",
    "output": "Associated to each C++ operators in violation, the Quality Rule provides:\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in the source code:\n  - Operator",
    "rationale": "Depending on the operator involved, the rationale is a variation of the same theme: the overloaded operator does not have the same behavior as the classical operator, therefore using it could be surprising and lead to subtle bugs.   \n\n* Logical OR and AND operators\n\nThe logical AND and logical OR operators (&&, ||) exhibit \"short circuit\" operation. That is, the second operand is not evaluated if the result can be deduced solely by evaluating the first operand. However, short-circuit evaluation is not possible for overloaded versions of these operators. Therefore, to avoid possibly confusing behavior, these operators should not be overloaded. \n\n* Comma Operator\n\nThe built-in comma operator guarantees that the first operand is evaluated before the second operand. However, if the comma operator is overloaded, its operand evaluation depends on C++'s function parameter mechanism, which does not guarantee the order of evaluation. Therefore, to avoid possibly confusing behavior, the comma operator should not be overloaded. \n\n* Ampersand Operator\n\nThe C++ standard [ISO/IEC 14882-2003] says in Section 5.3.1 paragraph 4 that \"The address of an object of incomplete type can be taken, but if the complete type of that object is a class type that declares operator&() as a member function, then the behavior is undefined.\" Therefore, to avoid possible undefined behavior, the operator & should not be overloaded. \n\nThe operators taken into account are unary operators, i.e. operators defined in a class with no argument and operators defined outside of a class with one argument. Binary operators (defined in a class with one parameter or out side of a class with two parameters) are not considered here.",
