    "output": "Associated to each C++ constructor, destructor, and method with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The number of violation patterns\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in source code:\n  - Call to 'std::find_first_of'",
    "rationale": "This algorithm is designed to be used in a case where you search for a limited number of candidates in a large set of data. If N is the set of searched elements and M the scope of elements to search, the time complexity of the method is 'O(N*M)'.\n\nIf the number of candidates becomes large, other methods exist whose complexity is 'O(N*log(M))' or even 'O(N)'. They use an associative container to store the list of possible candidates.\n\nIf the data type can only have a very limited number of values (such as 'char'), you can have another alternative with a bit set describing the values you are searching for. This is what a function tailored to 'char' might do (for instance, the C 'strpbrk' function).",
