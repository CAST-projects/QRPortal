    "description": "When enforcing the utilization of JavaDoc Comments to document an application, the @exception tags should be used to document the exceptions being thrown by a given Method. The number of exception thrown should match the number of @exception.\nIn JavaDoc, the @exception tag is deprecated and has been replaced by the @throws tag.",

    "rationale": "There is no dispute that these comments contribute to a developer's understanding and help a developer write reliable applications more quickly. Without documenting exception thrown it is dififcult for anyone else than the author to guess its purpose and consequences except by looking at the code that is throwing it.",
