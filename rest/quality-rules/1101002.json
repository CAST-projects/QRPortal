    "description": "List all SQL Artifacts (except tables) which contain a query on XXL tables that have a cartesian join, i.e; that does not explicitly state a join condition among the tables\nA cartesian join is found if, for any of the tables in the from clause, no column of the table is found in a join (either in the from or where clause).\nXXL tables are extremely large tables which contain a huge amount of data. The threshold that determines when a table is considered to contain a huge amount of data can be configured by the user.",
    "output": "The output lists all SQL Artifacts using at least one SQL query with a Cartesian product on XXL tables. \nThe following information is provided: \n- The number of violation patterns\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in the source code",
    "rationale": "Cartesian joins which lead to cartesian products are an absolute performance killer, especially when large data sets are involved which is the case when extremely large tables are involved.\nA cartesian join is a multiple-table query that does not explicitly state a join condition among the tables, it creates a Cartesian product. A Cartesian product consists of every possible combination of rows from the tables. This result set is usually extremely large and unwieldy, killing application performance.\nIn addition, most of the time, this is also a functional bug.",
