    "description": "This rule searches for C++ functions that hide variable declarations in nested scopes. It only checks parent scopes in the same function or the same class: hiding a global variable will not be detected.",
    "output": "Associated to each C++ method, constructor and destructor with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- Number of violation patterns\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in the source code:\n  - variable declaration that hides\n  - variable declaration that is hidden",
    "rationale": "Having the same name refer to two different objects can lead to confusion. In case of refactoring, when the code is moved around, a line of code can pick-up a different variable from the one intended. Hiding is also an indication that names may have been poorly chosen, and not informative enough.\n\nHiding with global names is not checked, because a modification in one part of the code could lead to a violation in another unrelated part.",
    "reference": "High Integrity C++ Coding Standard Manual",
    "remediation": "To correct that problem, choose different variable names.",
    "sample": "int i;\n\nint main()\n{\n    int i = 3; // Not a violation\n    int j = 2;\n    for (int j = 0 ; j<10 ; ++j) // Violation\n    {\n    }\n}",
