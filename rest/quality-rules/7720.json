    "rationale": "When too many EJB beans are created, the application performance can be poor because most of the functionalities will be run through a session (which means that the EJB container intercepts and processes many more method calls). Also, the application server itself may not perform as well because of the additional resources required to deploy and pool instances for many sessions.\nIn addition, there is more development effort due to all the session-related artifacts.",
