    "rationale": "Different PHP file inclusion API are intended for different scenarios. APIs \"require\" and \"require_once\" should be used when they are used at global level without checking whether file is included because those APIs have internal check. APIs \"include\" and \"include_once\" do not check whether the file is already included. Therefore, \"require\" and \"require_once\" should be used where file is included unconditionally and \"include\" and \"include_once\" should be used where file is included inside condition.",
