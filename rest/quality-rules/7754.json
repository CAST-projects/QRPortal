    "description": "This rule searches for Cobol programs using the COMPUTE statement for elementary arithmetic operation.\n\nExpressions with only one binary operator (+, -, *, /) are taken into account. Expressions based on the exponentiation operator ('**') are not considered as violating the rule.\n\nExpression with only one operand (with or without an unary operator) are taken into account. Example:\n- A = B\n- A = -1\n- A = 0",
    "output": "Associated to each COBOL Program with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The number of violation patterns\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in source code:\n  - COMPUTE statement",
    "rationale": "COMPUTE is a performance consuming statement and should be used to perform complex arithmetic operations. Simple operation should be performed by using ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY and DIVIDE statements that are more efficient and more easy to understand.",
