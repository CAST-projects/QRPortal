In the best case, this will prevent the user from seeing the information.  In the worst case, this can cause a runtime error when the field that is not exposed is required or otherwise has validation that prevents a user from saving a record.",

Select 'Check Mappings' from the pop-up menu.  If this option is not available then the object is not locked for the currently logged in user.\n5- If mapping conflicts exist then Siebel Tools will suggest repairing these problems by re-mapping the items appropriately.\n6- Save the modified applet.",
