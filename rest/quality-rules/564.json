    "description": "This rule searches for C/C++ files that include files other than header files (with file extensions like \".h\", etc). The extension list is a parameter and can be changed at will. \n\nNote: Including files without extensions is not considered as being problematic.",

    "rationale": "If a file includes a file that does not have a header extension this either means:\n- That naming conventions have not been respected, therefore making it harder to understand the program etc.\n- That code is duplicated at several locations breaking the encapsulation rules",
