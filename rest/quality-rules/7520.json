    "description": "This Quality Rule retrieves all ABAP artifacts which contain Open SQL statements or READ statements and that do not check the value of the return code SY-SUBRC. However, queries containing the COUNT function in their SELECT clause are not considered as a violation.\nThe rule takes in account the following cases:\n- Use of a temporary variable\n\nselect date_e into zdate_e \nfrom zkopcor\nwhere date_e lt p_run and p_doc eq 'TT'.\n\nTmp = SY-SUBRC.\n\nIF Tmp NE 0.\n    list of statements\nEND-IF.\n\n- Use of WRITE statement before return code checking\n\nselect date_e into zdate_e \nfrom zkopcor\nwhere date_e lt p_run and p_doc eq 'TT'.\n\nWRITE: / Do some testing.\n\nIF SY-SUBRC NE 0.\n    list of statements\nEND-IF.\n    ",
