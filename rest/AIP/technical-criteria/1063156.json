    "description": "Purpose\nIdentifying and listing all the entity\u2019s bespoke and custom software, and any third-party software that is incorporated into the entity\u2019s bespoke and custom software enables the entity to manage vulnerabilities and patches.\nVulnerabilities in third-party components (including libraries, APIs, etc.) embedded in an entity\u2019s software also renders those applications vulnerable to attacks. Knowing which third-party components are used in the entity\u2019s software and monitoring the availability of security patches to address known vulnerabilities is critical to ensuring the security of the software.\n\nGood Practice\nAn entity\u2019s inventory should cover all payment software components and dependencies, including supported execution platforms or environments, third-party libraries, services, and other required functionalities.\nThere are many different types of solutions that can help with managing software inventories, such as software composition analysis tools, application discovery tools, and mobile device management.\n",
