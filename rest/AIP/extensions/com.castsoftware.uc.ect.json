    "description": "The more applications in an Enlighten profile the longer it takes to launch. When Enlighten is installed as part of an enterprise CAST installation it can take as much as 20 minutes to launch. To alleviate this problem the CAST team has created a web based tool, CAST Enlighten Application Configuration, to limit the number of application is a user\u2019s profile. By keeping the Enlighten profile to 10 applications, or less, the launch time can be reduced to less than a minute.",
