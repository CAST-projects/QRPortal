    "description": "This extension provides support for the annotations introduced with JAX-RS (JSR 311). The analysis of your JEE/Spring application by the default AIP analyzer will be enriched with modelling of the REST API created with those annotations. This will enable transactions starting in a client application which uses these API (web app for instance) to be traced into the backend application.",
