The XML Process Definition Language (XPDL) is a format standardized by the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) to interchange business process definitions between different workflow products, i.e. between different modelling tools and management suites. XPDL defines an XML schema for specifying the declarative part of workflow / business process. Function Point counting and Sizing are supported. Quality is not supported. ",
