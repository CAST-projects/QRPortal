Examples include but are not limited to, files, application modules, folders, and database records. Essentially, if permissions are assigned to protect it, it can be considered a security object. Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident, or identify those responsible for one.\n\nAudit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).",
