    "description": "Applications that are categorized as having a high or moderate impact on the organization must provide immediate alerts when encountering failures with the application audit system.  It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability and system operation may be adversely affected. \n\nAudit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.\n\nWhile alerts provide organizations with urgent messages containing important information regarding application audit log activity, real-time alerts provide these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to alert occurs in seconds or no more than 1-2 minutes).  \n\nWithout a real-time alert, security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability and system operation may be adversely affected.",
