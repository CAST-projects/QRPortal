    "description": "Extensible Markup Language (XML) is widely employed in web technology and applications like web services (SOAP, REST, and WSDL) and is also used for configuration files. XML vulnerability examples include XML injection, XML Spoofing, XML-based Denial of Service attacks and information disclosure attacks.\n\nWhen utilizing XML, web applications must take steps to ensure they are addressing XML-related security issues. This is accomplished by choosing well-designed application components, building application code that follows security best practices and by patching application components when vulnerabilities are identified.\n\nXML firewalls or gateways may be employed to assist in protecting applications by controlling access to XML-based applications, filtering XML content, rate-limiting requests, and validating XML traffic.",
