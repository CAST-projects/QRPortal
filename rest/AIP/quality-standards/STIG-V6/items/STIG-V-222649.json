    "description": "This requirement is meant to apply to developers or organizations that are doing application development work.\n\nCode coverage statistics describes the overall functionality provided by the application and how much of the source code has been tested during the release cycle.\n\nTo avoid the potential for testing the same pieces of code over and over again, code coverage statistics are used to track which aspects or modules of the application are tested.\n\nSome applications are so large that it is not feasible to test every last bit of the application code on one release cycle. In those instances, it is acceptable to prioritize and identify the modules that are critical to the applications security posture and test those first. Rolling over to test other modules later as resources permit. E.g., testing functionality that performs authentication and authorization before testing printing capabilities.\n\nApplication developers should keep statistics that show all of the modules of the application and identify which modules were tested and when. This will help testers to keep track of what has been tested and help to verify all functionality is tested.\n\nThe developer makes sure that flaws are documented in a defect tracking system.\n\nIf the application is smaller in nature and all aspects of the application can be tested, the code coverage statistics would be 100%.",
