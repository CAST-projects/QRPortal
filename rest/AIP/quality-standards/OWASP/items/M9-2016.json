    "description": "Generally, all mobile code is susceptible to reverse engineering. Some apps are more susceptible than others. Code written in languages / frameworks that allow for dynamic introspection at runtime (Java, .NET, Objective C, Swift) are particularly at risk for reverse engineering. Detecting susceptibility to reverse engineering is fairly straight forward. First, decrypt the app store version of the app (if binary encryption is applied). Then, use the tools outlined in the \"Attack Vectors\" section of this document against the binary. Code will be susceptible if it is fairly easy to understand the app's controlflow path, string table, and any pseudocode/source-code generated by these tools.",
