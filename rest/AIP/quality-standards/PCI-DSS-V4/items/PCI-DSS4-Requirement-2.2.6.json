    "description": "Purpose\nCorrectly configuring security parameters provided in system components takes advantage of the capabilities of the system component to defeat malicious attacks.\n\nGood Practice\nSystem configuration standards and related processes should specifically address security settings and parameters that have known security implications for each type of system in use. \nFor systems to be configured securely, personnel responsible for configuration and/or administering systems should be knowledgeable in the specific security parameters and settings that apply to the system. Considerations should also include secure settings for parameters used to access cloud portals. \n\nFurther Information\nRefer to vendor documentation and industry references noted in Requirement 2.2.1 for information about applicable security parameters for each type of system.",
