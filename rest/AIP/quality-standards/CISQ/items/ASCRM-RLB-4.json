(in case of technologies with class elements, this means situations where a persistent storable data element is a class that is made persistent while it does not implement method elements from the required comparison control element list now composed of method elements: for example, with JAVA, a required comparison control element list is {'hashCode()','equals()'} method elements)\n\n",
