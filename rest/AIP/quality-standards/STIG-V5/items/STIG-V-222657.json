    "description": "An application incident response process is managed by the development team and should include a method for individuals to submit potential security vulnerabilities to the development or maintenance team. \n\nThe plan should dictate what is to be done with the reported vulnerabilities. Reported vulnerabilities must be tracked throughout the process to ensure they are triaged, corrected, and tested. The corresponding update is released to the user community and the user community is notified of the availability of the application update.\n\nWithout an established application incident management plan and process, discovered issues and vulnerabilities will go unreported.   Vulnerabilities will not be triaged and managed, and there may be delays in corrective actions.\n\nInformation on how to submit bug and vulnerability reports must also be included in the application design document or configuration guide.\n\nThis requirement is meant to be applied when reviewing an application with the development team.",
