    "description": "Once an attacker establishes access to a system, the attacker often attempts to create a persistent method of re-establishing access. One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to remove an account. Notification of account removal is one method for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive account management process will ensure an audit trail which documents the removal of application user accounts and notifies administrators and ISSOs such accounts no longer exist. This type of process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously removed and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.\n\nTo address access requirements, many application developers choose to integrate their applications with enterprise-level authentication/access/auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the application developer to offload those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality.",
