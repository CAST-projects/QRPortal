Backing up audit records to a different system or onto separate media than the system being audited on an organizationally defined frequency helps to assure in the event of a catastrophic system failure, the audit records will be retained.\n\nThis helps to ensure a compromise of the information system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records.\n\nThis requirement only applies to applications that have a native backup capability for audit records. Operating system backup requirements cover applications that do not provide native backup functions.",
