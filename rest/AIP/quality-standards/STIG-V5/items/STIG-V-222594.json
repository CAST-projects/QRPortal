    "description": "Denial of Service (DoS) is a condition where a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.\n\nIndividuals of concern can include hostile insiders or external adversaries that have access or have successfully breached the information system and are using the system as a platform to launch cyber attacks on the application, the application host or other third-parties.\n\nApplication developers and application administrators must take the steps needed to ensure an application cannot be used to launch DoS attacks against the application itself, the application host or other systems and networks. \n\nApplication developers should be cognizant that many attackers using DoS techniques will attempt to identify resource intensive processes and functions within the application.  For web applications, this can be application objects that perform database queries or other resource intensive tasks.  Improper application memory management can also lead to memory leaks which can exhaust system resources forcing a system or application restart.  \n\nLimiting attempts to repeatedly execute application processes by validating the requests also reduces the ability to launch some DoS attacks.\n\nFor application administrators, ensuring network access controls are in place to protect the application host.\n\nThe methods employed to counter DoS risks are dependent upon the application layer methods that can be used to exploit it.",
