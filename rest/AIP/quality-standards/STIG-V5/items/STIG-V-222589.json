    "description": "Applications handling data requiring \"data at rest\" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest.\n\nSelection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the confidentiality of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).\n\nSpecial care must be taken to cryptographically protect classified data.",
