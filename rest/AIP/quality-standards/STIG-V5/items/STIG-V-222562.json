    "description": "Privileged access contains control and configuration information which is particularly sensitive, so additional protections are necessary. This is maintained by using cryptographic mechanisms to protect integrity.\n\nNon-local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection.\n\nThis requirement applies to hardware/software diagnostic test equipment or tools. This requirement does not cover hardware/software components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of the system (e.g., the software implementing \"ping,\" \"ls,\" \"ipconfig,\" or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch).\n\nThe application can meet this requirement through leveraging a cryptographic module.",
