    "description": "Without integrity protection mechanisms, unauthorized individuals may gain access to sensitive information via a remote access session.\n\nRemote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.\n\nEncryption provides a means to secure the remote connection to prevent unauthorized access to the data traversing the remote access connection. Without integrity protection mechanisms, unauthorized individuals may be able to insert inauthentic content into a remote session. The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information.",
