To address this concern, the Program Manager will ensure all levels of program management receive security training regarding the necessity, impact, and benefits of integrating secure development practices into the development lifecycle.  \n\nThis training is in addition to DoD 8570 training requirements as DoD 8570 annual security training does not presently cover application SDLC security concerns.\n\nThe Program Manager will ensure development team members are provided training on secure design principles for the entire SDLC and newly discovered vulnerability types on, at least, an annual basis. \n\nDevelopment team members include:\n\n- Designers/Application Architects\n- Developers/Programmers\n- Testers\n- Application managers\n\nThis requirement applies to development teams or individual application developers and does not apply when reviewing a COTS application or an application hosted at a DECC or other hosting facility when the application team is not available to interview.",
