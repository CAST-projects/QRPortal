    "description": "The IP addresses of the systems that the application connects to are an important aspect of identifying application network related activity. Recording the IP addresses of the system the application connects to in the application logs provides forensic evidence and aids in investigating and correlating the sources of malicious behavior related to security events. Logging this information can be particularly useful for Service-Oriented Applications where there is application to application connectivity.",
