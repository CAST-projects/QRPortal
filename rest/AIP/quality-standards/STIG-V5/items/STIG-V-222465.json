    "description": "Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident, or identify those responsible for one.\n\nApplication objects are system or application components that comprise the application. This includes but is not limited to; application files, folders, processes and modules.\n\nThis requirement is not intended to force the use of debug logging which would be used for troubleshooting or forensic actions; rather it is intended to assure the application strikes a balance when auditing access to application objects and logs normal and potentially abnormal application activity.\n\nAudit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).",
