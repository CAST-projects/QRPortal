Error messages are an indicator of an organization's operational state or can identify application components. Additionally, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and operational information must not be revealed through error messages to unauthorized personnel or their designated representatives.\n\nThe structure and content of error messages must be carefully considered by the organization and development team. The extent to which the information system is able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.\n\nError messages should not include variable names, variable types, SQL strings, or source code. Errors that contain field names from the screen and a description of what should be in the field should not be considered a finding.",
