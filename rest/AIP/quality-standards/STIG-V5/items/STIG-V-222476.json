    "description": "Without information about the outcome of events, security personnel cannot make an accurate assessment as to whether an attack was successful or if changes were made to the security state of the system.\n\nEvent outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the information system after the event occurred). As such, they also provide a means to measure the impact of an event and help authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response.\n\nSuccessful application events are expected to far outnumber errors.   Therefore, success events may be implied by default and not specified in the logs if this behavior is documented.",
