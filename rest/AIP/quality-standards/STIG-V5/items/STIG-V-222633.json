An SCM plan or charter identifies what should be under configuration management control. Without an SCM plan and a CCB, application releases can't be tracked and vulnerabilities can be inserted intentionally or unintentionally into the code base of the application.\n\nThis requirement is intended to be applied to application developers or organizations responsible for code management or who have and operate an application CM repository.",
