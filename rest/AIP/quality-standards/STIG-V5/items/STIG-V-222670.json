When a security flaw is discovered in an application deployed in a production environment, notification to the user community must take place as quickly as possible. \n\nThis notification should be planned for in the design phase of the application. This notification should be a warning of any potential risks to the application or data. A notification mechanism will be established to notify users of the vulnerability and the potential risks, the availability of a solution, and/or potential mitigations reducing risks to the application.",
