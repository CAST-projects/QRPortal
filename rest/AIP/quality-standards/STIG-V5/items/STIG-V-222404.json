    "description": "SAML is a standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between security domains.  SAML uses security tokens containing assertions to pass information about a principal (usually an end user) between a SAML authority, (identity provider), and a SAML consumer, (service provider).  SAML assertions are usually made about a subject, (user) represented by the <Subject> element.\n\nWhen a SAML assertion is used with a <Conditions> element, a begin and end time for the <Conditions> element should be set in order to specify a timeframe in which the assertion is valid. Not setting a specific time period for the <Conditions> element, the possibility exists of granting immediate access or elevated privileges to an attacker which results in an immediate loss of confidentiality.",
