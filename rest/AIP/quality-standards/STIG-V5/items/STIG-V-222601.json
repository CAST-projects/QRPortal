    "description": "Hidden fields allow developers to process application data without having to display it on the screen.  Using hidden fields to pass data in forms is a common practice among web applications and by itself is not a security risk.  \n\nHowever, hidden fields are not secure and can be easily manipulated by users.  Information requiring confidentiality or integrity protections must not be placed in a hidden field.   If data that is sensitive must be stored in a hidden field, it must be encrypted.\n\nFurthermore, hidden fields used to control access decisions can lead to a complete compromise of access control mechanisms allowing immediate compromise of the user's application session.",
