    "description": "Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.\n\nOrganizations consider limiting the additional audit information to only that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. The additional information required is dependent on the type of information (i.e., sensitivity of the data and the environment within which it resides). At a minimum, the organization must audit either full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group users, or both. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise. \n\nIn addition, the application must have the capability to include organization-defined additional, more detailed information in the audit records for audit events.",
