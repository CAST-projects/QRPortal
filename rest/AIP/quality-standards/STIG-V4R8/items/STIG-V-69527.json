Organizations document specific user actions that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication; and \n(ii) Accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity.",
