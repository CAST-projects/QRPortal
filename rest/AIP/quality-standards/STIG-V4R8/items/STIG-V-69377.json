    "description": "Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident, or identify those responsible for one.\n\nAudit records can be generated from various components within the application (e.g., process, module). Certain specific application functionalities may be audited as well. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.\n\nThe IP addresses of remote systems that connect to the application are an important aspect of identifying the sources of application activity. Recording these IP addresses in the application logs provides forensic evidence and aids in investigating and identifying sources of malicious behavior related to security events.",
