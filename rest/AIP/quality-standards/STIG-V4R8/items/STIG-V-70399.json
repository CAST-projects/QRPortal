The application support staff should maintain procedures for decommissioning. The decommissioning process should include notifying users of the pending decommissioning event. If the users are not informed of the decommissioning event, attackers may be able to stand up similar looking system and fool users into attempting to log onto a duplicate system. This can be as simple as a banner informing users.\n\nThis risk is primarily geared towards insider threat scenarios and externally accessible applications that provide access to publicly releasable data but should also be applied to internal systems as a best practice.",
