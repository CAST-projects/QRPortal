FICAM provides Government-wide services for common Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) requirements.  The FICAM Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) is the federated identity framework for the U.S. federal government.\n The TFS is a process by which Industry Trust Frameworks (The codification of requirements for credentials and their issuance, privacy and security requirements, as well as auditing qualifications and processes) are evaluated and assessed for potential use by the Government.  \n\nThis requirement only applies to applications that are intended to be accessible to non-federal government agencies and other partners or non-organizational (non-DoD) users.\n\nWithout conforming to FICAM-issued profiles, the information system may not be interoperable with FICAM-authentication protocols, such as SAML 2.0, OpenID 2.0 or other protocols such as the FICAM backend Attribute Exchange.\n\nThis requirement addresses open identity management standards.
