Using only authorized software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThe organization must identify authorized software programs and permit execution of authorized software. The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting.\n\nVerification of whitelisted software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.\n\nThis requirement applies to configuration management applications or similar types of applications designed to manage system processes and configurations (e.g., HBSS and software wrappers).",
