Time ordering refers to the chronological organization of records based on time stamps. The degree of time stamp precision can affect this.\n\nAudit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts.\n\nThis requirement is specific to applications with audit reduction capabilities; however, applications need to support on-demand audit review and analysis.",
