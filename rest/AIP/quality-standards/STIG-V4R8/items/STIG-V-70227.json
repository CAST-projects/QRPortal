    "description": "Applications handling data requiring \"data at rest\" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest.\n\nSelection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).",
