    "description": "To prevent the compromise of authentication information such as passwords during the authentication process, the feedback from the information system must not provide any information that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism.\n\nObfuscation of user-provided information when typed into the system is a method used in addressing this risk.\n\nFor example, displaying asterisks when a user types in a password is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication information.\n\nAnother method is to display authentication feedback for a very limited time, usually in fractions of a second. This occurs during password character entry where the password characters are displayed for a very small window of time and then automatically obfuscated. This allows users with just enough time to confirm their password as they type it while limiting the ability of \"shoulder surfers\" to covertly witness the values.\n\nA common tactic employed to circumvent password obfuscation is to copy the obfuscated password and paste it to a text file.  Proper obfuscation techniques will not paste the clear text password.",
