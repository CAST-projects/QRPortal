Enforcement action methods may be as simple as denying access to a file based on the application of file permissions (access restriction). Audit items may consist of lists of actions blocked by access restrictions or changes identified after-the-fact.\n\nIf application configuration is maintained by using a text editor to modify a configuration file, this function may be delegated to an operating system file monitoring/auditing capability.",
