The risks increase when these applications are exposed to untrusted networks.\n\nXML-based firewall functionality can be used to prevent common attacks and aid in protecting and limiting the risks of exposing web services to untrusted networks.  The XML firewall functionality may be stand-alone or embedded in various multi-purpose products including but not limited to a SOA or Web Application gateways.",
