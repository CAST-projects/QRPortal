    "description": "Without the association of security attributes to information, there is no basis for the application to make security related access-control decisions.\n\nSecurity attributes are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information.\n\nThese attributes are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., records, buffers, files) within the information system and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security policy.\n\nOne example includes marking data as classified or FOUO. These security attributes may be assigned manually or during data processing but either way, it is imperative these assignments are maintained while the data is in storage. If the security attributes are lost when the data is stored, there is the risk of a data compromise.\n\nClassify the system hosting the application with default classification.  Treat all unmarked data at the highest classification as the overall hosting system is classified.  If there is no classification, mark system high.",
