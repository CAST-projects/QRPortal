If the application does not provide the ability to centrally review the application logs, forensic analysis is negatively impacted.\n\nSegregation of logging data to multiple disparate computer systems is counterproductive and makes log analysis and log event alarming difficult to implement and manage, particularly when the system or application has multiple logging components written to different locations or systems.\n\nAutomated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include, for example, Security Information Management products.",
