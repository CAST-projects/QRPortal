    "description": "Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security of the application. Verifying software components have been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.\n\nAccordingly, patches, service packs, or application components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.\n\nVerifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The application should not have to verify the software again. This requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved CA.\n\nIf this capability is not present, the vendor must provide a cryptographic hash value that can be verified by a system administrator prior to installation.",
