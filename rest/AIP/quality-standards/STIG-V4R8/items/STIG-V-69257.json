Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.\n\nEncryption provides a means to secure the remote connection to prevent unauthorized access to the data traversing the remote access connection thereby providing a degree of confidentiality. The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information.",
