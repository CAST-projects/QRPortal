    "description": "To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems (e.g., networks, web servers, and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. \n\nSuccessful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to a restricted asset or security boundary.\n\nAuthorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset.\n\nInformation systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.\n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies.\n\nAccess enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography.\n\nThese policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.\n\nThis requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications (e.g., authentication servers) and other applications that perform information and system access control functions.",
