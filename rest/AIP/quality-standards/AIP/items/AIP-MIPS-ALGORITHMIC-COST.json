    "description": "MIPS Reduction assess the level of resources that are wasted on account of sub-optimal coding regarding Efficiency and Robustness areas. Sub-optimal coding regarding Efficiency cause unnecessary consumption of resources, that will ultimately cause unnecessary consumption of electrical power when applications run in production. Sub-optimal coding regarding Robustness cause unnecessary consumption of resources, when it comes down to application shutdown and restart because it failed or because its integrity was corrupted.",
