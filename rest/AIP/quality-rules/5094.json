    "output": "Associated to each COBOL Program with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in source code:\n  - MOVE CORRESPONDING statement",
    "rationale": "The CORRESPONDING option allows moving fields from a data structure to another by using their respective names with only one statement. This option works silently because the moved fields are not explicitly specified and this can lead different problems: \n- A field is defined into only one data structure\n- Two fields defined in the both data structures have the same name but not the same type. \nIn the first case, the field will not be moved and the data will be lost. In the second case, data fields with different (incompatible?) types will be moved the one into the other and the data will be corrupted because of truncated size or bad conversion.",
    "remediation": "Try as much as possible to replace the MOVE CORRESPONDING statements by explicit MOVE statements or add explanations about fields to be moved in the code.",
