Use an \"accept known good\" validation strategy. Reject invalid input rather than attempting to sanitize potentially hostile data. Do not forget that error messages might also include invalid data\"\n\nThe Common Weakness Enumeration defines Improper Input Validation ( CWE-20 ) as follows :\n\n\"When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\"",
