    "rationale": "The Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data.\nDES is now considered to be insecure for many applications. This is mainly due to the 56-bit key size being too small. In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see chronology).\nSome analytical results demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, Attack have been also demonstrated in practice. Even in the form of Triple DES, it is believed to be insecure.\nDES has been withdrawn as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. (NIST)",
