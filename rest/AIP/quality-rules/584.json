    "output": "Associated to each C++ class with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in source code:\n  - Virtual method",
    "rationale": "Whenever a virtual method is defined in a class, it means that the class is intended to be used in an inheritance hierarchy. In this context, a derived object will often be handled through a pointer to its base class, to achieve polymorphism. If a class has a non-virtual destructor, and an attempt is made to destroy an object of a derived type through a pointer to the base type, the behavior is undefined.\n\nOn some platforms, it may call the base-class version of the destructor instead of the derived-class version, provoking memory leaks, resource losses and stability issues. On others, it may simply crash.\n\nFurthermore, once your class contains one virtual function, adding a virtual destructor does not add any additional per-object cost, so adding it is both free and safer.",
