    "output": "Associated to each ABAP artifact in violation, the Quality Rule provides: \n- The number of calls to system functions\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in source code: \n  - CALL 'SYSTEM'",
    "rationale": "OS command injection occurs when an application accepts untrusted input (forms, cookies, HTTP headers, special characters etc.) to build operating system commands or there is an insufficient sanitizing . Executed commands will run with the privileges of a vulnerable service.\n\n\nAn attacker can use OS command execution vulnerability to execute operating system commands without authentication. As for SAP, an attacker can access arbitrary files and directories located in an SAP server file system including application source code, configuration, and critical system files. The vulnerability allows obtaining critical technical and business-related information stored in a vulnerable system",
