    "rationale": "When Entity bean instance is to be passed by value as a detached object (e.g., through a remote interface), the entity class must implement the Serializable interface.\n\nAlso, In some cases an OptimisticLockException will be thrown and wrapped by another exception, such as a RemoteException, when VM boundaries are crossed. Entities that may be referenced in wrapped exceptions should be Serializable so that marshalling will not fail.\n\nA consequence of not following this rule when a non serializable entity is passed by value is to get an exception.",
