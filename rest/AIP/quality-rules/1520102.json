    "rationale": "If this user property is not defined, Business Components based on S_PARTY table may not work properly.\nFor example, without this user property, the correct base table, and corresponding de-normalized information cannot be loaded.\nTherefore, de-normalized columns (such as columns in S_ORG_BU, S_ACCNT_POSTN, S_POSTN_CON and others) are not updated when creating a new record.\nThe bottom line is data corruption in Siebel repository.",

For a given Business Component, the value associated with the property that has the lowest number is the primary extension table. \n\nFor example, for the standard \u201cEmployee\u201d Business Component, \u201cInner Join Extension Table 1\u201d has value S_CONTACT, \u201cInner Join Extension Table 2\u201d has value S_USER and \u201cInner Join Extension Table 3\u201d has value S_EMP_PER.
