    "description": "A violation is raised when a Superclass directly knows about its Subclasses. This happens when a Superclass directly calls a Subclass-method, uses a Subclass-attribute or refers to the name of the Subclass. This rule is compliant with CISQ ASCRM-RLB-14 recommendation.",

    "rationale": "Referencing down the inheritance tree is against Object-Oriented coding practices. It is a way of having two-way inheritance between class and subclass. This is an indication of poor class design and use of class inheritance. Such practices increase the complexity of the application.",
