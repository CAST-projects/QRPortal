    "rationale": "APIs tend to expose more endpoints than traditional web applications, making proper and updated documentation highly important. Proper hosts and deployed API version inventory also play an important role to mitigate issues such as deprecated API versions and exposed debug endpoints.\nWhen there is a presence of exposed APIs which are in-fact not getting called by any call-to-web-services there is a chance that some of these APIs are actually meant to be retired, belong to a deprecated version, or are used for debugging. This can lead to an attacker being able to access data/information that is no longer intended to be accessed.\n\nOld API versions are usually unpatched and are an easy way to compromise systems without having to fight state-of-the-art security mechanisms, which might be in place to protect the most recent API versions.",
