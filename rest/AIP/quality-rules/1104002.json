    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "If the cardinality MANY TO ONE is specified, any database that supports this addition assumes that the results set defined by the left outer join matches this cardinality and SQL Optimizer attempts to suppress any surplus joins. \nFor exemple, When defining outer joins as LEFT OUTER MANY TO ONE joins, if no field is requested from the joined table, the database can avoid executing the join at runtime.",
