    "rationale": "An attacker can inject a protocol handler, such as http:// or ftp://, to include remote PHP files and to execute system commands. Further, an attacker is able to include arbitrary files from the file system as PHP code. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive files or to the execution of PHP code that has been placed by the attacker on the file system, for example by injecting a payload into a log file.",
