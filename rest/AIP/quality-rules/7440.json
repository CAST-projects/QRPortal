    "description": "Find all methods in an inheritance tree that have the same signature but whose name differs only by capitalization and methods that have the same name but are overridden with a different signature (this signature doesn't exist in the super class) with the following restrictions:\n- where the class implements an interface, if one method with the same signature exists in the class then no violation will be reported even if other methods exist with different signatures\n- where the class extends another class, a violation will be reported for a method only when the number of parameters are the same and one of the parameters of the signature of the child class method inherits from a parameter in the same place as the parent class method with the same name.",
    "output": "This report lists all methods that override a similar method name or signature. It provides the following information:\n  - Method full name\n  - Method overridden",
    "rationale": "When programming it is very easy to make a mistake when naming a method to override or in its signature. This may occur when writing the inherited class, but also when changing the signature of the basic class to add a new parameter or when changing the type of a parameter. One of the more typical examples is the overriding of equals methods with an argument type that is different from the Object class.",

    "remediation": "Fix the name of the method or the signature and if you use JSE 5.0 or later add the @Override annotation to inform the compiler that the method is meant to override a method declared in a superclass. If the method marked with @Override fails to correctly override a method in one of its superclasses, the compiler generates an error.",

            "description": "Coding standards are guidelines established by the development team or individual developers that recommend programming style, practices and methods.  The coding standards employed will vary based upon the programming language that is being used to develop the application and the development team.\n\nCoding standards often cover the use of white space characters, variable naming conventions, function naming conventions, and comment styles.  Implementing coding standards provides many benefits to the development process.  These benefits include code readability, coding consistency among both individual and teams of developers as well as ease of code integration.  \n\nThe following are examples of what will typically be in a coding standards document.  This list is an example of what one can expect to find in typical coding standard documents and is not a comprehensive list:\n\n- Indent style conventions\n- Naming conventions\n- Line length conventions\n- Comment conventions\n- Programming best practices\n- Programming style conventions\n\nCoding standards allow developers to quickly adapt to code which has been developed by various members of a development team.  Coding standards are useful in the code review process as well as in situations where a team member leaves and duties must then be assigned to another team member.  \n\nCode conforming to a standard format is easier to read, especially if someone other than the original developer is examining the code.  In addition, formatted code can be debugged and corrected faster than unformatted code.\n\nIntroducing coding standards can help increase the consistency, reliability, and security of the application by ensuring common programming structures and tasks are handled by similar methods, as well as, reducing the occurrence of common logic errors."
