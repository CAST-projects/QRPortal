    "rationale": "- The Action classes are almost totally independent of the names of the presentation pages. The pages can be renamed (for example) during a redesign, with negligible impact on the Action classes themselves. If the names of the \"next\" pages were hard coded into the Action classes, all of these classes would also need to be modified.\n- If Struts tags are used, then if a reference to a JSP page is directly made,  the behaviour of the Struts tags may become unpredictable. This because the ActionServlet or FilterDispatcher in Struts intercepts the request and provides appropriate attributes such as Message Resource Bundles and also FormBeans.\n\nThe code at one architectural layer invokes code that resides at a deeper layer than the adjacent layer, i.e., the invocation skips at least one layer, and the invoked code is not part of a vertical utility layer that can be referenced from any horizontal layer.",
