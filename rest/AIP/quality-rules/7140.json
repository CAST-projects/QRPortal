The pages can be renamed (for example) during a redesign, with negligible impact on the Action classes themselves. If the names of the \"next\" pages were hard coded into the Action classes, all of these classes would also need to be modified.\n- If Struts tags are used, then if a reference to a JSP page is directly made,  the behaviour of the Struts tags may become unpredictable. This because the ActionServlet or FilterDispatcher in Struts intercepts the request and provides appropriate attributes such as Message Resource Bundles and also FormBeans.",
