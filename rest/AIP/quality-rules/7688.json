    "description": "This rule searches for Cobol programs containing MOVE statements where data are truncated.\n\nData assignments are checked for MOVE and MOVE CORRESPONDING statements. \n\nDecimal part of numeric variables is not taken into account and these variables are considered like variables not having decimal part. \nThe rule will not detect violations related to decimal part and violations related to position:length accesses (in source variables and in target variables).",

    "rationale": "If a variable or a group is moved into another that is shorter, then it will be truncated and part of the information will be lost. This is going to generate troubles in production. In addition, data defined after the target data could be overridden and an abend can occur.",
