    "rationale": "Sun.*' Classes should not be used. Sun preserves the right to change the structure of those Classes without notice or documentation. Also, sun.* packages are not guaranteed to work on all Java-compatible platforms. These classes will not in general be present on another vendor's Java platform. If your Java program asks for a class \"sun.package.Foo\" by name, it may fail with ClassNotFoundError, and you will have lost a major advantage of developing in Java.",
