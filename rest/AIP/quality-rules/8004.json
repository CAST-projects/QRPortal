    "rationale": "'delete this' leaves the current instance in a \"dangling\" state, which may lead to undefined behavior. 'delete this' is only valid if you can guarantee that the instance members will no longer be accessed. Furthermore, 'delete this' is only valid if you can guarantee the object was allocated using the 'new' operator.\n\nThere are acceptable patterns of code where delete this is used. For instance, when a class is always dynamically allocated, only referenced by a manager, and unregisters itself from the manager on destruction. It is possible for an instance of the class to \"commit suicide\" by using 'delete this' when it discovers it is no longer needed. However this pattern and its implication are usually not well understood, and other solutions are preferred.",
