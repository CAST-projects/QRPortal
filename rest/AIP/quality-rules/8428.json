However, these checks are not done by default when a user programmatically starts a new transaction by calling the CALL TRANSACTION statement. If there is no explicit authorization check performed before this statement, the user running the ABAP program will be able to start a transaction that is otherwise not allowed.\n\n\nThe use of the statement CALL TRANSACTION without one of the additions WITH AUTHORITY-CHECK or WITHOUT AUTHORITY-CHECK is now obsolete.",
