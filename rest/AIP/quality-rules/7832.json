    "description": "All Classes should be referenced.\nAn unreferenced Class is a class\n1- which is not referenced from other  classes and\n2- where none of its members is referenced from other members of other classes.\n3- a class that has no static main method \n\nAs of today, this excludes references from other languages (for instance, JSP calling static members. This case will be handled in the future).",

    "rationale": "Unreferenced code may be the symptom of Dead Code. Dead Code must be avoided as it makes source code less readable and increases the cost of the software maintenance.\n\nWarning:\nUnreferenced code can also be the symptoms of missing code (code not included in the source code analysis) and / or can be the symptom of use of polymorphism.\nThe intensive use of polymorphism can make the application easier to change but much more difficult to test, debug and stabilize.",
