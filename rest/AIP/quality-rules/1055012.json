This rule is compliant with OWASP M3 2016 and with CISQ-OMG ASCSM-CWE-327 recommendations.",

    "rationale": "Mobile apps that communicate over the Internet often fail to properly implement SSL/TLS, if they\nimplement it at all. These failures could leave users\u2019 communications open to interception and even\nsession hijacking. Using SSL/TLS properly involves careful checking of the server\u2019s certificate chain. Thus,\nan app or library that validates SSL/TLS certificates should do the following checks to ensure strong\nauthentication, confidentiality and integrity.",
