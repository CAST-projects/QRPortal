These failures could leave users\u2019 communications open to interception and even\nsession hijacking. Using SSL/TLS properly involves careful checking of the server\u2019s certificate chain. Thus,\nan app or library that validates SSL/TLS certificates should do the following checks to ensure strong\nauthentication, confidentiality and integrity.",

This inconsistency leads to the risk of exposing data and session IDs to interception. The use of transport security does not mean the app has implemented it correctly. To detect basic flaws, observe the phone's network traffic. More subtle flaws require inspecting the design of the application and the applications configuration."
