    "description": "The cookies with an overly broad path, such as the root context path (\"/\"), can be accessed by all web applications on the same domain name. A cookie with sensitive data, but with too broad a path, could hence be read and tampered by a less secure and untrusted application. This rule is compliant with OWASP 2013 A6 and 2017 A3 - Sensitive Data Exposure",
