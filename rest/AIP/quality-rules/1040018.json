    "description": "The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a frame or iframe. Sites can use this to avoid Clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites. Set the X-Frame-Options header for all responses containing HTML content. The possible values are \"DENY\", \"SAMEORIGIN\", or \"ALLOW-FROM uri\".\nThere are three possible values for the X-Frame-Options header:\n\n1. DENY, which prevents any domain from framing the content. The \"DENY\" setting is recommended unless a specific need has been identified for framing.\n2. SAMEORIGIN, which only allows the current site to frame the content.\n3. ALLOW-FROM uri, which permits the specified 'uri' to frame this page. (e.g., ALLOW-FROM http://www.example.com) Check Limitations Below this will fail open if the browser does not support it. Other browsers support the new CSP frame-ancestors directive instead. A few support both.\nThis rule report violation when the value of \"X-Frame-Options\" is not specified or it's set to ALLOW.",
    "rationale": "Clickjacking is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick users into clicking on a button or a link on another page when they are intending to click on the top level page. Thus, the attacker is \"hijacking\" clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both.\nUsing a similar technique, keystrokes can also be hijacked. With a carefully crafted combination of stylesheets, iframes, and text boxes, users can be led to believe that they are typing in the password to their email or bank account, but are instead typing into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker.",
