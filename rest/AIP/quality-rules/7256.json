    "description": "Utility classes must have a private default constructor, but not other constructors. Default constructors are constructors without any parameters. Utility classes are static classes: all their fields and methods are static.",
    "output": "The Quality Rule will list all classes with all fields and static methods that do not have at least one private default constructor. It will also list all classes with all fields and static methods that, in addition to the private default constructor, have other constructors.",
    "rationale": "Utility classes are not meant to be instantiated because all the functionalities that they provide are accessible without instantiating the class. Instantiating these classes means that the developer has misused the class. It also consumes memory unnecessarily. Instead, providing a private default constructor ensures that the class is not instantiated.",
