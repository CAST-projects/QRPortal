    "description": "This rule searches for functions that contain a 'break' statement in a 'for' loop. 'break' statements located in nested loops will also be reported as a violation to this rule.\n\nNote: For C#, foreach statements are not considered because there is no stop condition in the loop definition. Break statements located in nested loops will also be reported as a violation to this rule.\nNote that in VB .NET, the break statement is \"Exit For\"",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "A 'for' loop must be straightforward to read. Using too many 'break' statements in 'for' loops makes them more difficult to read.",
