    "rationale": "The ON CHANGE OF statement can prove dangerous and is often misunderstood. Also, troubleshooting problems created by inadequate use of ON CHANGE OF statement can often be time-consuming because such errors are very difficult to reproduce and often appear to be random ones. Indeed, the use of  the ON CHANGE OF statement is not suitable within functions or subroutines as many developers expect the comparison field's value to be reset for every new function call which is not the case. \nThe  control structure ON CHANGE OF - ENDON is not allowed in ABAP Objects, i.e. in a method.",
