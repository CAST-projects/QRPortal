    "description": "This rule retrieves all ABAP artifacts using SELECT ... ENDSELECT statement on tables and views. This rule applies only XXL database tables. Loops using the addition UP TO 1 ROWS (or UP TO ONE ROWS) are not considered as violations.\n\nXXL tables are extremely large tables which contain a huge amount of data. The threshold that determines when a table is considered to contain a huge amount of data can be configured by the user.",
