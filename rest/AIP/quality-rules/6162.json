    "description": "Avoid Artifacts with High integration complexity (IC greater than X). Complex programs are difficult to maintain. Keeping programs small and simple ensures an good readability of the code.  PB Artifacts are Methods, Functions, Datawindows, Datastores, Events, ... The threshold level is a parameter that can be changed at will.",
    "rationale": "Integration Complexity equals the minimum number of tests to check the Artifact's integration behavior.\nHigh IC means more testing and higher risk of errors.",
    "remediation": "Review the design of the Artifact to reduce the number of independent integration paths. E.g.: reduce the number of CALL statements.",
