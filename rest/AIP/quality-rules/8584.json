    "rationale": "Using the File name instead of a full file path in ABAP's OPEN DATASET statement can pose potential security issues, primarily due to unintended File Access (Path Traversal Vulnerability):\nIf only a file name is used, and the system uses a default or current directory, there's a risk that an attacker could manipulate file paths to access files outside the intended directory. This is known as a path traversal attack.\n\nFor example, if an input like ../../etc/passwd is used as a file name, it could potentially access sensitive files on the server, depending on the system's configuration and permissions.",
