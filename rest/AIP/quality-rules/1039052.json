For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. In some scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.",
