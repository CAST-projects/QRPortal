    "description": "Avoid Classes with High Coupling Between Objects (CBO > X)\nThe Coupling Between Objects (CBO) is equal to the fan-out of a Class, that is, the number of other Classes that are referenced through one of its methods or one of its fields. \nThe threshold is a parameter and can be changed at will.",
    "output": "This report lists all Classes with Coupling Between Objects greater than X. It provides the following information:  Class full name, CBO",
    "rationale": "Excessive coupling between objects is detrimental to modular design and prevents reuse. \nThe larger the number of couples, the higher the sensitivity to changes in other parts of the design and therefore the more difficult the maintenance.",
    "reference": "A Metrics Suite for Object Oriented Design\nChidamber, S.R. and C.F. Kemerer\nIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1994",
    "remediation": "High CBO numbers might indicate that a class has too many responsibilities. Such a class is potential candidate for a refactoring where the class would delegate some the responsibilities to other classes or new classes (Extract Class, Extract Method refactoring). This will increase modularity and reusability.\n\nWhen refactoring with architecture in mind, the CBO metric can be used to check classes running on the application client that have high coupling. These classes are then good candidate for a refactoring towards the Session Facade pattern (Java-originated pattern that is also applicable to the .NET platform):\nhttp://java.sun.com/blueprints/patterns/SessionFacade.html",
