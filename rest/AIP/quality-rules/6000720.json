    "description": "The following statements indicate that the Reporting mode is used: DOEND, LOOP, OBTAIN and SET GLOBALS. These statements are counted; any artifact that has any of these statements will be reported as a violation.",
    "rationale": "Generally, it is recommended to use structured mode exclusively, because it provides for more clearly structured applications. Reporting mode is only useful for the creation of ad-hoc reports and small programs which do not involve complex data and/or programming constructs. (If you decide to write a program in reporting mode, be aware that small programs may easily become larger and more complex). Structured mode is intended for the implementation of complex applications with a clear and well-defined program structure. The major benefits of structured mode are:\n\u0095 The programs have to be written in a more structured way and are therefore easier to read and consequently easier to maintain.\n\u0095 As all fields to be used in a program have to be defined in one central location (instead of being scattered all over the program, as is possible in reporting mode), overall control of the data used is much easier.",
