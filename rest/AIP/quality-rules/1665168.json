    "description": "A Transformation is identical with another one if he has same number of fields, same fields type and same expressions.\nThis metric measures the ratio between the number of copy/pasted transformations and the total number of transformations. \nAlso, for optimal efficiency, the rule is enabled only for transformations larger than X fields.\nThe X threshold is a parameter and can be changed at will",
    "output": "This report lists all copy/pasted Transformations.\nIt provides the following information:\nMapping or Mapplet full name, Source Qualifier full name and duplicated Source Qualifier name",
    "rationale": "A mapping with a lot of duplicate transformations is hard to change and to maintain. It might be required to change every copy of a copy/pasted object while it is very difficult to locate these copy/pasted code elements.",
