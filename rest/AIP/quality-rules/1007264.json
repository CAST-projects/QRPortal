    "rationale": "a remote code execution can be achieved by uploading a PHP file into the document root. Often, the file extension plays an important role and depending on the web server's configuration, different file extensions such as .php, .php4, or .php.zzz are passed to the PHP interpreter. Furthermore, uploading a .htaccess file can lead to remote code execution and uploading .htm, .html, .swf, or .svg files can lead to persistent cross-site scripting.",
