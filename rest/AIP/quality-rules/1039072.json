If the classes of the objects which are to be reconstructed are specified by the attackers and if they force the application to run arbitrary setters with user-controlled data, in this scenario the attacker may gain access to execute arbitrary code during deserialization of YAML stream.\n\njYAML project is abandoned and must not be used to deserialize YAML.",
