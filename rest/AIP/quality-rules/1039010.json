Well-known techniques may exist to break the algorithm.\n\nMD5/SHA1 hashes were used as salt to hash a password or a passphrase. In cryptography, a salt is random data that's used as additional input to a one-way function. \nRecently, several exploits were developed which proved that MD2, MD4, Bouncy Castle & JCE with SHA1 or MD5 will generate identical outputs for the different input parameters. \n\nThe following hashing algorithms: SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 are recommended instead. \n\nSHA-256 is a 256-bit hash function intended to provide 128 bits of security against collision attacks, \nwhile SHA-512 is a 512-bit hash function intended to provide 256 bits of security. A 384-bit hash may be obtained by truncating the SHA-512 output",
