An attacker, through social engineering (e.g., e-mail or chat) creates a hyperlink which executes unwanted actions on the website the victim is authenticated to and sends it to the victim. If the victim clicks on the link, the action is executed unbeknownst to the victim.\n\nA CSRF attack executes a website request on behalf of the user which can lead to a compromise of the user\u2019s data. What is needed to be successful is for the attacker to know the URL, an authenticated application user, and trick the user into clicking the malicious link.\n\nWhile XSS is not needed for a CSRF attack to work, XSS vulnerabilities can provide the attacker with a vector to obtain information from the user that may be used in mitigating the risk. The application must not be vulnerable to XSS as an XSS attack can be used to help defeat token, double-submit cookie, referrer and origin-based CSRF defenses."
