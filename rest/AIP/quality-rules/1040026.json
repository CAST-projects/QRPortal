    "description": "A @RequestMapping method handles all matching requests by default. That means that a method you intended only to be POST-ed to could also be called by a GET, thereby allowing hackers to call the method inappropriately. For example a \"transferFunds\" method might be invoked like so: <img src=\"http://bank.com/actions/transferFunds?reciepientRouting=000000&receipientAccount=11111111&amount=200.00\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"/>\n\nFor that reason, you should always explicitly list the single HTTP method with which you expect your @RequestMapping Java method to be called.",
