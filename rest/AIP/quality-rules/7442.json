    "description": "This rule detects all cases where keyword 'this' is - directly or not - referenced in a constructor.\nIndirect reference to keyword 'this' means the definition of an inner class in the constructor. \nIt includes also the case where the constructor call the method start of a thread within a constructor (i.e. a method that inherits from java.lang.Thread.start())",
    "output": "This report lists all constructors that involve keyword 'this' directly or indirectly.\nIt provides the following information:\n  - Method full name\n  - the number of occurrences of keyword 'this' detected in the constructor",
    "rationale": "When making a reference to keyword 'this' within a constructor - either directly or indirectly through inner classes - visible to another thread, the result can be unpredictable.\nMoreover, testing and debugging multi-threaded programs is very difficult, because of concurrency hazard that makes difficult to reproduce the issue.",
