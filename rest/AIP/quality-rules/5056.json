    "output": "Associated to each COBOL Program with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The number of violation patterns\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in source code\n- Bookmarks for table declaration of violation patterns found in source code\n- SEARCH ALL statement",
    "rationale": "To use the SEARCH ALL statement to search a table, the table must specify the ASCENDING or DESCENDING KEY phrases of the OCCURS clause, or both, and must already be ordered on the key or keys that are specified in the ASCENDING and DESCENDING KEY phrases.\n\nIn the WHEN phrase of the SEARCH ALL statement, you can test any key that is named in the ASCENDING or DESCENDING KEY phrases for the table, but you must test all preceding keys, if any. The test must be an equal-to condition, and the WHEN phrase must specify either a key (subscripted by the first index-name associated with the table) or a condition-name that is associated with the key. The WHEN condition can be a compound condition that is formed from simple conditions that use AND as the only logical connective.\n\nEach key and its object of comparison must be compatible according to the rules for comparison of data items. Note though that if a key is compared to a national literal or identifier, the key must be a national data item.\n\nThe developer must verify that the data stored into the table are sorted. If not, this can generate unexpected results and performance issue when the program is running.",
