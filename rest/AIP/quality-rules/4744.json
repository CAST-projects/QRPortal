In that case EJB has to use remote interface (if not using session facade pattern)\n>> If we are to check this condition only when the session facade pattern is used then total needs to be changed.",

    "rationale": "Best practices recommend that Entity beans only use Local Interface methods to expose their functions. So since, EJB 2.0, remote interface should not be used. Instead, opt for local interface as part of session fa\u00e7ade implementation. \nThis avoids the need for the JNDI lookup, which improves the performance",
