    "rationale": "The implementation of Web Dynpro routines (Supply methods for example) is governed by special conventions. Some ABAP language statements cannot be used.\nInserting source text using the INCLUDE statement is not allowed. If this rule is violated, the integrity of the Web Dynpro application cannot be guaranteed. Where source text is inserted with INCLUDE, the changes are not validated. This results in undefined behaviour when running the routines.",
