    "description": "This rule searches for C/C++ functions that are defined with parameters of 'struct' or 'class' type passed by value. If the classes are small with trivial copy operation, the rule is not triggered.",
    "output": "Associated to each C/C++ function and method with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n  - the number of parameters that are defined by value\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code:\n  - function or method",
    "rationale": "In C++, passing a 'class' or 'struct' object by value creates a copy of the object, by calling the copy constructor of the class. This copy can be slow, especially on big objects. The same applies for C 'struct' even if the copy constructor is not called.",
    "remediation": "Pass the argument by reference (with 'const'). This may require that you add missing 'const' qualifiers to class functions.",
