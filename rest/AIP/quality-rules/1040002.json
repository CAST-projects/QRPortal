Instead by default Spring Security\u2019s CSRF protection will produce an HTTP 403 access denied.\nThis rule reports violation when Spring Security\u2019s CSRF protection is deactivated.",

    "rationale": "When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution. There multiple forms of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks that can be avoided using Spring Security.",
