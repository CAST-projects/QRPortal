    "description": "Since each iteration through the loop results in a property lookup either on the instance or on a prototype, the for-in loop has considerably more overhead per iteration and is therefore slower than the other loops. For the same number of loop iterations, a for-in loop can end up as much as seven times slower than the other loop types. For this reason, it's recommended to avoid the for-in loop unless your intent is to iterate over an unknown number of object properties.",
