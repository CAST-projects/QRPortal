Depending on the assets you are protecting, perhaps this risk should be at the top of the list. jQuery 3.0.0-rc1 is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to removing a logic that lowercased attribute names. Any attribute getter using a mixed-cased name for boolean attributes goes into an infinite recursion, exceeding the stack call limit. This rule has been listed as CVE-2012-6708 in the CVE registry.",
