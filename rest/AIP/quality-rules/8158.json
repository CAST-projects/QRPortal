It manages multiple threads for different types of components, and in order to effectively maximize performance and resource utilization, it requires control of the threads being run on a given machine.\n\nMore often than not, threads are created when there is no time to implement a better solution. However, the consequences can be serious in terms of performance and robustness.",
