    "description": "Efferent Coupling between packages (Ce) measures the total number of external classes coupled to classes of a package due to outgoing coupling. This is an indicator of the package's independence.\nThis rule reports all classes ( and interfaces ) of a package with a high efferent Coupling. \n\nThe threshold contains the maximum efferent coupling.",
    "output": "This report all APM Java Classes of a package with a high efferent Coupling. \nIt provides the following information: \n- Class (Or Interface) \n- CE",
    "rationale": "Excessive coupling is detrimental to modular design since classes are not independent. A large efferent coupling indicates that a class is unfocussed and may also indicate that it is unstable since it depends on the stability of all the types to which it is coupled. This prevents reuse since a high coupling possibly indicates a package is poorly designed and difficult to understand/maintain. Extracting classes from the original class so the class is decomposed into smaller classes can reduce efferent coupling, this improves modularity and promotes encapsulation.",
