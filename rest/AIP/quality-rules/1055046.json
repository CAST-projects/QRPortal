    "description": "This rule aims at the detection of vulnerabilities based on the (possibly unresolvable) non-local character of a concatenated/interpolated string passed to the \"WKWebView.evaluateJavaScript\" method.",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "In Swift one can inject directly JavaScript code via a string passed to \"WKWebView.evaluateJavaScript\". This string might be hard-coded (i.e. with a fixed value at compile time) or constructed at run-time. If this construction has a non-local character (e.g. concatenation with string fragments received from outside of the enclosing method), or moreover, it relies on (untrusted) external sources, it can eventually open a means for an attacker to inject malicious code.",

    "remediation": "Ensure the code constructing the string containing the JavaScript code is well encapsulated, and most of all, avoid using untrusted external data if given the case.\n\nSanitizing the string just before passing to \"evaluateJavaScript\" can eventually deflect attack attempts.",
