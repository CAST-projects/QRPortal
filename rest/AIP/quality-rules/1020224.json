    "description": "The rule will raise a violation when web service, HTTP calls are made inside loops. The calls made with following APIs are considered and detected:\n- Axios\n- vue-resource\n- $http<nuxtjs>\n- $axios<nuxtjs>",

    "rationale": "When designing web service to get/put/post data, you want to make sure that you minimize the number of calls between the client application and web service server. By minimizing the number of calls, you improve application speed, reduce communications overhead (why send three requests when you can do it by one), and reduce network traffic.",
