    "description": "All Subroutines should be referenced. An unreferenced Artifact is an Artifact that is not explicitly called from within the analyzed code.",
    "output": "This report lists all unreferenced Subroutines",
    "rationale": "Unreferenced code may be the symptom of Dead Code. Dead Code must be avoided as it makes source code less readable and increases the cost of the software maintenance. Warning: Unreferenced code can also be the symptoms of missing code (code not included in the source code analysis) and / or can be the symptom of use of polymorphism. The intensive use of polymorphism can make the application easier to change but much more difficult to test, debug and stabilize.",
