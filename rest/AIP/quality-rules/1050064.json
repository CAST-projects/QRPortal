    "description": "MD5/SHA1 hashes were used as salt to hash a password or a passphrase. In cryptography, a salt is random data that's used as additional input to a one-way function. Recently, several exploits were developed which proved that MD5 will generate identical outputs for the different input parameters. As a consequence, somebody can break your encryption or log on to your website.",
