    "rationale": "For scenarios where entities are read but not updated, consider using the AsNoTracking method. This informs EF that the entities are not being modified, eliminating the need for change tracking and improving performance.\nWith EF and EF Core, the AsNoTracking method provides a simple yet powerful means to enhance the speed of read operations. By using AsNoTracking, you can reduce memory overhead, speed up query execution, minimize network traffic, and improve the overall scalability of your application.\n\nThis option allows EF to turn off the object cache and unnecessary identity management of the objects.\nApplies to Entity Framework 5.0.0 and Entity Framework 4.3.1",
