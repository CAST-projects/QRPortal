    "rationale": "Autonomous Database allows most of the data types available in Oracle Database. To ensure the security and the performance of Autonomous Database, some data types are restricted. In dedicated deployments, the ROWID data type is not enabled by default. You can enable it by setting the ALLOW_ROWID_COLUMN_TYPE initialization parameter to true.\n\nHowever, if you enable it, be aware that ROWID columns are incompatible with rolling upgrade operations and other internal operations that physically move a row. \n\nAt a minimum, database activities involving ROWID should be suspended during upgrades. Applications using ROWID columns should introduce correctness validation to mitigate against logical errors in the application if a row relocates.",
