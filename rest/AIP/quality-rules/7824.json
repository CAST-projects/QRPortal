    "description": "This Quality Rule reports all methods throwing  an exception of type Exception. The exception Exception should never been thrown.",
    "output": "This report lists all Artifacts throwing an exception of type Exception.\nIt provides the following information:\n- Artifact full name",
    "rationale": "Whenever a method throws an exception of type Exception, it prevents its callers from carrying out the specific recovery process that is needed and as a consequence this will threaten both application robustness and security. For example, each exception related to resource allocation whose catch does not explicitly release the resource might create a \"resource leak\". When a leak occurs on a limited set of available resources, such as a database connection, the application can then become unusable because resources cannot be allocated any more. \nThe application also becomes difficult to support and run in production as root-cause analysis is made more difficult. The support teams might not even be aware that something went wrong (by catching Exception, RuntimeException might not be visible any more).",

If no data protection requirements are defined as to what specific data must be encrypted and what data is non-sensitive and doesn't require encryption, all data must be encrypted.\n \nWhen transmitting data, applications need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms, such as TLS, SSL VPNs, or IPSEC.\n\nCommunication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa."
