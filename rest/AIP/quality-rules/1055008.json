    "description": "When using the CCCrypt function, you must provide an encryption key size. The current cryptography guidelines suggest that a key length of at least 2048 bits should be used with the RSA algorithm. However, continued advancements mean that future increases in the recommended key size are inevitable. When it comes to symmetric encryption, the key lengths should be at least 128 bits.",

    "rationale": "Insecure use of cryptography is common in most mobile apps that leverage encryption. There are two fundamental ways that broken cryptography is manifested within mobile apps. First, the mobile app may use a process behind the encryption / decryption that is fundamentally flawed and can be exploited by the adversary to decrypt sensitive data. Second, the mobile app may implement or leverage an encryption / decryption algorithm that is weak in nature and can be directly decrypted by the adversary.",

Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa."
