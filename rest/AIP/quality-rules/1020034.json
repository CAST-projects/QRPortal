This attribute, quite similar to data URIs, is capable of hosting HTML text to be rendered by the browser as the content of the Iframe.

This attribute should if at all only be used in combination with the Iframe Sandbox. This rule is compliant with CISQ OMG ASCSM-CWE-079 recommendation and OWASP 2013 A3 recommendation.",
