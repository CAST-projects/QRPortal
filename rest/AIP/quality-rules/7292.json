    "output": "This report lists all packages with static cyclical call to or inheritance with another Java Package.\nIt provides the following information:\n  - Package full name\n  - cyclically called / inherited Package full name",
    "rationale": "When two packages refer to each other through a call, the result is a circular dependency. Neither packages can function without the other, and so neither is reusable without the other. In some cases redesign may eliminate these dependencies.\nWhen circular references are necessary, redesign it to ensure reusability. The same problem happen when some classes from a package A inherit from classes of a package B and other classes from package B inherit from other classes from package A. This rule can be extended to circular dependencies for more than 2 packages (for example a package A call a package B that call a package C, that call package A).",
