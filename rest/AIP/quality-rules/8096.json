    "rationale": "Due to rounding errors, most floating-point numbers end up being slightly imprecise. As long as this imprecision stays small, it can usually be ignored. However, it also means that numbers expected to be equal (e.g. when calculating the same result through different correct methods) often differ slightly, and a simple equality test fails.\nA comparison between a floating point number and an integer has the same problem, since the integer is cast into a floating point for the comparison.",
