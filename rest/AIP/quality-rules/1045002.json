    "description": "select-before-update (defaults to false): specifies that Hibernate should never perform an SQL UPDATE unless it is certain that an object is actually modified. Only when a transient object has been associated with a new session using update(), will Hibernate perform an extra SQL SELECT to determine if an UPDATE is actually required.\n\nUse of select-before-update will usually decrease performance. It is useful ONLY to prevent a database update trigger being called unnecessarily if you reattach a graph of detached instances to a Session.\n\nThis rule reports a violation for Hibernate Entity having 'select-before-update' set to true except when it's associated to a table that fires an UPDATE trigger.",
    "output": "List all Hibernate Entities that set select-before-update to true and that are not associated with a table that fires an UPDATE trigger.",
    "rationale": "Triggers and object-relational mapping often create issues due to the difficulties of synchronizing the effect of a trigger with the representation of data in memory.\nTo enhance performances, it is a best practice to use the attribute select-before-update for the persistent class associated to a table that have the UPDATE trigger.\nBut if the table is not associated to an UPDATE trigger, then it will affect your performance since the application will perform unnecessary SELECT.",
