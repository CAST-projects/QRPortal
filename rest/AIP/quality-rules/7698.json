Furthermore, what if there is no more disk space available or not enough space has been allocated to allow for addition of new data. Other errors, such as attempting to close a file that isn't open, or to read a file opened for output only, may well derive from logical errors (that is, programming mistakes) but can be dealt with nonetheless when debugging. These kinds of errors will normally result in termination of the program run, whereas using File Status can allow the programmer to deal with any such problems without the program run stopping and returning to the operating system.",
