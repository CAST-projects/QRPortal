For example, var hourHand=myGrandFather.clock.hands.hour make three lookup. When used too much in a loop, dot notation can affect performance of a javascript function. Reducing the dotation usage can win 50% of the time consumed by this function. This rule is compliant with CISQ OMG ASCPEM-PRF-4 recommendation.",
