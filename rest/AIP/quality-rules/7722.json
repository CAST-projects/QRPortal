    "rationale": "Since the programmer can define the meaning of Java Equality, it is important not to use the id field in this definition if the id field is a surrogate key. This is because Hibernate only sets the field when saving the object. Hence, for example, if you add the object to some set collection, then saving the object will result in its identity changing, and part of the rules about using Set/Map collection class is that the contained object's identity must not change while it is in the collection (the behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object is changed in a manner that affects equals comparisons while the object is an element in the set. A special case of this prohibition is that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element).\n\nFor example:\nPerson p = new Person();\nSet set = new HashSet();\nset.add(p);\nSystem.out.println(set.contains(p));\np.setId(new Long(5));\nSystem.out.println(set.contains(p));\n\n==> Prints:  false\n\nAs the behavior of a Set/Map is not specified if the value of an object is changed in a manner that affects equals comparisons while the object is an element in the Set or is the key of a Map., you may corrupt you database.",

In cases where the business key is composite, you can use  the Jakarta Commons libraries - in particular the EqualsBuilder and HashCodeBuilder classes.
