    "description": "This rule searches for C++ functions, methods, constructors, and destructors where at least one local variable is not initialized at declaration time. This applies to standard types ('char', 'int', etc) and pointers of any type. This does not apply to: \n- classes (i.e. local declarations like: 'myclass var;') as they have a constructor\n- structs and arrays\n\nVariables that are initialized after their declaration are considered as initialized as long as this is done before any program logic.",
    "output": "Associated to each C++ Function/Method/Constructor/Destructor with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- Number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code:\n  - Uninitialized variable",
    "rationale": "Using a variable that is not initialized can lead to unexpected behavior. Some compilers may detect the use of uninitialized variables in some cases, but none can detect them all. For example the following sample remains undetected: \n\nvoid take_ptr(int * ptr) \n{\n    printf(\"%lx\", *ptr); \n} \n\nvoid main() \n{ \n    int c;\n    take_ptr(&c); \n}",
