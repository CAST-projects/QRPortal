The threshold that determines when a table is considered to contain a huge amount of data can be configured by the user.",

    "rationale": "Cartesian joins which lead to cartesian products are an absolute performance killer, especially when large data sets are involved which is the case when extremely large tables are involved.\nA cartesian join is a multiple-table query that does not explicitly state a join condition among the tables, it creates a Cartesian product. A Cartesian product consists of every possible combination of rows from the tables. This result set is usually extremely large and unwieldy, killing application performance.\nIn addition, most of the time, this is also a functional bug.",
