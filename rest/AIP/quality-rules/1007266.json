    "output": "This report lists all artifacts that raw user input that could lead to SQL injection.\nThis QR provides the following information:\nArtifact Full Name",
    "rationale": "An attacker can modify the SQL syntax and alter the query's target or result. This can lead to the retrieval of sensitive information from the database or to an attack against the underlying web server by using SQL file operations. An attacker can also elevate privileges if the SQL query is used for authentication. It is recommended to use prepared statements and to run the database user with the least privileges necessary.",
