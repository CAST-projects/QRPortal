    "description": "This rule searches for Classes with High Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM > X). LCOM measures the correlation between the methods and the local instance variables of a class. High values indicate that instance variables are accessed by different sets of methods, so that the class could be split in 2 or more entities. The threshold used to mark a class as in error is a parameter and can be changed at will.\n\nThis rule uses the LCOM5 version of the LCOM metric (sometimes called LCOM*). It is a variant of rule 7798, the difference being that it does not take into account methods that do not access any field.",
    "output": "This report lists all Classes with Lack of Cohesion in Methods greater than X.\nIt provides the following information: \n- Class full name\n- LCOM value",
    "rationale": "Cohesiveness of Methods within a Class is desirable, since it promotes encapsulation. Low cohesion increases complexity, thereby increasing the likelihood of errors during the development process.",

It is typically difficult to detect these types of issues through manual code review. Instead, attackers will use third-party tools that perform static analysis or perform fuzzing. These types of tools will typically identify memory leaks, buffer overflows, and other less severe issues that result in bad programming practice. Hackers with extreme low-level knowledge and expertise are able to effectively exploit these types of issues. The typical primary goal is to execute foreign code within the mobile code's address space."
