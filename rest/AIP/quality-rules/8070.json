    "description": "This rule searches for C functions, C++ methods, constructors, and destructors that contain 'for' bodies in which a control variable is altered.\nWe consider a variable as altered when we assign it a new value, or when it is passed as a non-const reference to a function (including calling a non-const member function on the variable if it is of class type).",
