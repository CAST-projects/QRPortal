    "output": "Associated to each C++ method, constructor, and destructor with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- pointer incorrectly casted\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in source code:\n  - pointer cast\n  - source class\n  - target class",
    "rationale": "Casting from pointer to base class to pointer to derived class should usually be done through 'dynamic_cast'. See rule #8060 for more information.\n\nIn performances-constrained situations, and if you know through another mean that the 'dynamic_cast' will succeed, you can instead call 'static_cast', which will be slightly more efficient. In this case, it is advised to write code that will check in debug builds that the assumption is true.\n\nIn any case, a C-style cast is unsafe to use, because it will be considered as a 'reinterpret_cast' if the classes are not related, and will do the wrong thing.",

            "description": "Coding standards are guidelines established by the development team or individual developers that recommend programming style, practices and methods.  The coding standards employed will vary based upon the programming language that is being used to develop the application and the development team.\n\nCoding standards often cover the use of white space characters, variable naming conventions, function naming conventions, and comment styles.  Implementing coding standards provides many benefits to the development process.  These benefits include code readability, coding consistency among both individual and teams of developers as well as ease of code integration.  \n\nThe following are examples of what will typically be in a coding standards document.  This list is an example of what one can expect to find in typical coding standard documents and is not a comprehensive list:\n\n- Indent style conventions\n- Naming conventions\n- Line length conventions\n- Comment conventions\n- Programming best practices\n- Programming style conventions\n\nCoding standards allow developers to quickly adapt to code which has been developed by various members of a development team.  Coding standards are useful in the code review process as well as in situations where a team member leaves and duties must then be assigned to another team member.  \n\nCode conforming to a standard format is easier to read, especially if someone other than the original developer is examining the code.  In addition, formatted code can be debugged and corrected faster than unformatted code.\n\nIntroducing coding standards can help increase the consistency, reliability, and security of the application by ensuring common programming structures and tasks are handled by similar methods, as well as, reducing the occurrence of common logic errors."
