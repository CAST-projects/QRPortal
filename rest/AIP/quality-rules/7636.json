    "rationale": "In theory, a timestamp is slightly less safe, since two concurrent transactions might both load and update the same item all in the same millisecond; in practice, this is unlikely to occur. However, we recommend that new projects use a numeric version and not a timestamp.\nFor example, you might encounter this issue: after daylight savings took effect, every call to update an entry into my database created before daylight savings took effect would result in a StaleObject-StateException.\nIf your timestamp data type doesn't include a daylight saving time attribute, you'll run into problems with Hibernate's automatic versioning. A version property is less problematic for automatic versioning; hence we recommend it.",
