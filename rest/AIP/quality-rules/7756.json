    "description": "This rule searches for COBOL programs using READ statements without the AT END or INVALID KEY clause.\n\nNotes:\n- READ statements executed against QSAM files should have an AT END clause. \n- READ statements executed against VSAM files should have an INVALID KEY clause. \n- No violation is raised on files for which the SELECT ASSIGN clause has not been found. This can occur when copybooks are missing.",

    "rationale": "When reading data from files, it is important to manage all the situations that can occur and especially when there is no data to read. If the \"end of file\" is not managed or if a key is not found, then invalid data can be read and abnormal behavior can occur.",
