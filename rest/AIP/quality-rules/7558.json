    "output": "Associated to each COBOL Program with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in source code:\n  - Data accessed via a position and a length in the PROCEDURE division",
    "rationale": "Parts of data can be accessed by using their position and their length in a data group. This mechanism is error prone for two points: the developer can introduce errors in defining the position of the part of data to access. \nIn addition, this position is dependent of any changes in the data before placed before it.\nThus, problems can easily occur in production and data may be corrupted.",
    "remediation": "Data which need to be accessed partially must have detailed fields. Then, look for accesses using position and length and replace them by fields accesses.",
