Only variables defined in the WORKING-STORAGE section are taken into account. A variable is considered as initialized in the following conditions:\n- Its definition has a VALUE clause\n- It is valued by a statement (for instance, MOVE, ADD, COMPUTE, INITIALIZE, ...)",

If data is moved or compared to other data without having been initialized, then the logic of the code could be unpredictable and problems can occur in production.",
