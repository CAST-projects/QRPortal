Therefore, you should always take extra precautions to make sure you are not hanging on to a MediaPlayer instance longer than necessary. When done with it, you should always call release() to make sure any system resources allocated to it are properly released \n\nUsually is not sufficient to release resources at onDestroy() level, you should ensure doing this in onPause(), onStop().",
