    "description": "This rule searches for all cases where SELECT queries without an ORDER BY clause or a subsequent SORT are followed by statements that require the result set (internal tables) to be sorted. The following ABAP statements require internal tables to be sorted:\n    - AT NEW\n    - AT END OF\n    - AT FIRST\n    - AT LAST\n    - DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM ...\n    - READ TABLE ...

    "rationale": "In order to ensure a smooth migration to SAP HANA, it is crucial to ensure that existing ABAP code behaves the same after the migration as before. While the support for SAP HANA is fully compatible based on the specified and documented feature set of Open SQL, ABAP code relying on implicit sorting behavior (i.e. undocumented sorting behavior in Open SQL) may require adaptation. \nFor systems running of HANA, SAP recommends to keep load away from the database, but push data-intensive calculations to the database where applicable.",
