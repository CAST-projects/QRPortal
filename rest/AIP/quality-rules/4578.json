    "description": "When a collection is returned as a returned value from a Function, it should be of the Interface type, and not as the Class. Collections are considered to be any classes implementing java.util.Collection, java.util.Collection<E>, java.util.Map or java.util.Map<U,V> or one of their sub-interfaces.",
