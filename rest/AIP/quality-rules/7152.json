    "rationale": "Servlets must be programmed in a thread-safe manner, because the controller will share the same instance for multiple simultaneous requests. In addition to the servlet's threading model, if your intention is to store request-specific state and if your container provides clustering facilities, there's no guarantee that the same servlet instance will receive all the requests (from one user or all users) in a Web application.\n\nThe use of non static final fields within a Servlet creates a security breach as this object is shared among multiple sessions and thus can lead to confidential data leaks.",
