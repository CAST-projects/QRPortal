    "rationale": "The PeopleCode compiler is not an optimizing compiler, unlike some current compilers for languages such as C++. For example, the PeopleCode compiler does not do common subexpression analysis. So, sometimes, if you have a complicated bit of PeopleCode that is used often, you can isolate the common expression yourself. This isolation can make your code look cleaner and make your code faster, especially if it is in a loop.\nThe compiler has to evaluate each occurrence of the expression, even though it would only execute it once.",
