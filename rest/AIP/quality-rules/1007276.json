In order to harden against related attacks, such as session riding that can lead to the compromise of user data or the takeover of adminstrator sessions, a secure configuration of sensitive cookies is crucial. It has been detected that a new cookie is set insecure within the HTTP response header which can be improved by enabling additional flags.",
