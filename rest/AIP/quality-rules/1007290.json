    "description": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability occurs when user input is embedded unsanitized into the HTML response page of the web application. It allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the response page of a tampered request.",
    "output": "This report lists all artifacts that allow cross site scripting through single quoted attribute. \nThis QR provides the following information:\nArtifact Full Name",
    "rationale": "Usually, this attack is performed by crafting a malicious link that is sent to a victim. When opened, the attacker's JavaScript payload within the link is reflected by the application and executed in the victim's browser in the context of the web application's domain. This enables the attacker to perform phishing attacks or to steal cookies associated with the domain.",

    "remediation": "For this purpose, the PHP built-in function htmlentities() with the parameter ENT_QUOTES can be used that performs this transformation. Besides, it is recommended to use double quotes for HTML attributes.",
