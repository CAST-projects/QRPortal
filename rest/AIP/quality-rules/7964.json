    "description": "Reports Managed bean and Java methods that call a constructor of the class used to define this Managed bean. \n\nThe class can be instantiated directly (by new) or also by getBean. \nEven though the getBean method is part of the Spring framework, it is considered as a bad practice to use it since it bypasses the Spring inversion of control mechanism. It will access directly the Bean factory, to either retreive the singleton instance of the bean, or create another instance of that bean. \nThe behavior is implicit, dependent on the way the bean is confiigured, and cannot be known by the caller. That's why this call is considered as an explicit instantiation. \nInstead, the developer should rely on Spring's injection to wire the bean to the proper location, and access it with an accessor. \n    ",
    "output": "This report lists Java methods and jsp files that call a constructor of the class used to implement a managed bean and the managed bean name\n\nIt provides the following information:\n - The full name of the methods that invoke the constructor of a managed bean implementation class\n - the managed bean name",
    "rationale": "When a class is used to instantiate a managed bean, this bean benefits from different key features of the underlying framework :\n    * Each bean is a component which can take advantage of all services of the framework (for instance, declarative transaction management in Spring)\n    * With CDI or Spring, the bean is eligible for injection into other objects.\n \nSo, if a class is instantiated as a managed bean and as a direct Java instance at the same time, for these two instances, you may see different and unpredictable behavior.",
    "remediation": "Use only managed beans and when you need different instances of the same class, use the prototype mode attribute.",
