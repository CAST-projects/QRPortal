    "description": "Azure SQL Database no longer supports non-ANSI join syntax, specifically the legacy *= operator used for left outer joins. Queries using this old syntax will fail during execution in Azure SQL Database. This affects any T-SQL statements that rely on implicit or non-standard join expressions.",

    "rationale": "Non-ANSI join syntax, such as the *= operator for left outer joins, has been deprecated for years in favor of the ANSI SQL JOIN syntax, which is clearer, more maintainable, and standard across platforms. Azure SQL Database enforces the use of ANSI-compliant syntax to ensure consistency, compatibility, and better query optimization. Relying on deprecated styles increases the risk of runtime failures and hampers modernization efforts.",

    "remediation": "To ensure compatibility with Azure SQL Database:\n\nReplace all non-ANSI join expressions (e.g., *= for left joins) with standard LEFT OUTER JOIN clauses.\n\nRefactor affected queries to use the JOIN ...
