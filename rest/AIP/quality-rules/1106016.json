As this is a session level setting, you must set it before each session as following: \nBEGIN\n  UTL_HTTP.SET_WALLET(path => 'file:/var/opt/oracle/dbaas_acfs/grid/tcps_wallets');\nEND;\n/\n\n--------------------------\nUTL_SMTP \n- Connections through IP addresses are allowed.\n- Egress ports 25, 465, 587, and 2525 are enabled by default.\n- Both simple and secure (SSL) SMTP endpoints are accessible.\n- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Email Delivery Service and third-party SMTP servers are both supported as email providers. However, unlike Oracle Enterprise Edition on-premises database, you cannot set up localhost as the SMTP server. The sendmail() service is also disabled on the platform.\n- The APEX_MAIL PL/SQL package is layered on UTL_SMTP.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information please refer to https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/arpls/UTL_HTTP.html and \nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/arpls/UTL_HTTP.html#GUID-CE6A8141-23EE-4907-9783-DDF4624BCC29",
