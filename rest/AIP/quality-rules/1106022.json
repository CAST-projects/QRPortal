When creating a new table using the SERIAL pseudo-type, a sequence is created.\n\nAdditional types from the same family are SMALLSERIAL and BIGSERIAL.\n\nBy assigning a SERIAL type to a column as part of table creation, PostgreSQL creates a sequence using default configuration and adds the NOT NULL constraint to the column. The new sequence can be altered and configured as a regular sequence.\n\nSince PostgreSQL 10, there is a new option called identity columns which is similar to SERIAL data type but more SQL standard compliant. The identity columns are highly compatibility compare to Oracle identity columns.",
