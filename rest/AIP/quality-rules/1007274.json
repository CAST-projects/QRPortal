    "rationale": "An attacker can inject objects of any class type with arbitrary properties into the application's scope by providing these in a serialized string format. When the object defined by the attacker is instantiated, certain magic methods of the injected class type, such as __wakeup() and __destruct(), are automatically invoked. Depending on the magic methods defined within the application's code and the involved properties that can be controlled by the attacker, further vulnerabilities or code can be triggered.",
