    "rationale": "In an Evaluate statement, the When clauses continue to be evaluated until an End-evaluate or a Break statement is encountered.\nIf you have an Evaluate statement with a number of When clauses, and you only expect one of them to match, put a Break statement following the likely clause. Otherwise, all the subsequent When clauses are evaluated. Your program is still correct, but it is inefficient at runtime, particularly if you have a large number of When clauses, and the Evaluate statement is in a loop.",
