    "rationale": "A frequent issue when dealing with stream is resource leak. This mainly comes from an incorrect code that miss to close the stream in any cases. Incorrect resource management is a common source of failures in production applications, with the usual pitfalls being database connections and file descriptors remaining opened after an exception has occurred somewhere else in the code. This leads to application servers being frequently restarted when resource exhaustion occurs, because operating systems and server applications generally have an upper-bound limit for resources.",
