    "rationale": "There is no dispute that these comments contribute to a developer's understanding and help a developer write reliable applications more quickly. Without documenting classes and interfaces it is dififcult for anyone else than the author to guess the purpose of the class or interface except by looking at the code and eventually the code called by the methods in the class.",
