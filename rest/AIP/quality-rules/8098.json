This weakness is frequently introduced in code that constructs log messages, where a constant format string is omitted.\nIn cases such as localization and internationalization, the language-specific message repositories could be an avenue for exploitation, but the format string issue would be resultant, since attacker control of those repositories would also allow modification of message length, format, and content.\nAs a consequence, format string problems allow for information disclosure which can severely simplify exploitation of the program.",
