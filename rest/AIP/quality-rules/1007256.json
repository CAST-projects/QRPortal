    "description": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability occurs when user input is embedded unsanitized into the HTML response page of the web application. It allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the response page of a tampered request. Usually, this attack is performed by crafting a malicious link that is sent to a victim. When opened, the attacker's JavaScript payload within the link is reflected by the application and executed in the victim's browser in the context of the web application's domain. This enables the attacker to perform phishing attacks or to steal cookies associated with the domain.",

    "rationale": "The detected injection occurs within a script element that executes JavaScript code. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by altering the current JavaScript syntax or by terminating the current JavaScript context with a script element and injecting a new HTML element.",
