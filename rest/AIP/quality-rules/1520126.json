    "description": "The column that the Field is mapped to is stored as a property in the Knowledge Base. Whenever the Business Component has the same Column mapped, the Business Component is reported as a violation.\n\nLimitation: the implementation does not consider the active/inactive status of the Field.\nTherefore some violations may be reported in the case of 2 fields are mapped to same column, but 1 of the 2 fields is inactive, for instance.",
    "output": "This rule reports all Fields within a Business Component which are mapped to the same column",
    "rationale": "When two or more BusComp fields are mapped to the same table column, it can lead to the following problems:\n* If both fields are active in the same BusComp context, it can lead to duplicate column insert errors during an insert or copy operation.  This behavior occurs most frequently during a copy.\n* It adds to repository overhead and introduces maintenance difficulties.",
    "remediation": "Custom fields should not be mapped to a column that is already being used by a standard field or another custom field.\nIn the case where the fields in question are intended to represent two different attributes, use two different columns, creating a custom extension column on the base table for one of the attributes if necessary.\nIn the case where the new field was created in order to change the name displayed in the user interface, use the standard field and re-label the applet controls as necessary.",
