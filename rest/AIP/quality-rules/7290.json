    "description": "This rule searches for Cobol programs containing sections or paragraphs that are not called. A section or a paragraph is not called when:\n- there is no GO TO statement that refers to it\n- there is no PERFORM statement that refers to it\n- there is no fall through logic in which it is involved\n\nHowever, sections for which all statements are attached to a paragraph are excluded from the list of objects violating this rule.",

    "rationale": "Unreferenced Sections and Paragraph may be the symptom of Dead Code. Dead Code must be avoided as it makes source code less readable and increases the cost of the software maintenance.\n\nWarning:\nUnreferenced code can also be the symptoms of missing code (code not included in the source code analysis).",
