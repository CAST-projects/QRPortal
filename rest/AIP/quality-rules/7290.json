A section or a paragraph is not called when:\n- there is no GO TO statement that refers to it\n- there is no PERFORM statement that refers to it\n- there is no fall through logic in which it is involved\n\nHowever, sections for which all statements are attached to a paragraph are excluded from the list of objects violating this rule.",
