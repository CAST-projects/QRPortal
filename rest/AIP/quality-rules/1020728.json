    "description": "Cross-site scripting attacks often access cookies in an attempt to steal session identifiers or authentication tokens. This is why all major browsers support the HttpOnly cookie property that prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie. When HttpOnly is not enabled, attackers may more easily access user cookies. This rule is compliant with OWASP 2013 and 2017 A6 - Sensitive Data Exposure",
