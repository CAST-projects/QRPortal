To be remotely accessible an endpoint also has to be exposed via JMX or HTTP. Most applications choose HTTP, where the ID of the endpoint along with a prefix of /actuator is mapped to a URL. For example, by default, the health endpoint is mapped to /actuator/health.\n\nEndpoint Security\nTo enable the features of Endpoint security authentication\nMakes the critical endpoints as non-critical and non-sensitive",
