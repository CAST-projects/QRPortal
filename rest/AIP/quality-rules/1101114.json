    "description": "This quality rule reports the SQL artifacts containing queries using the \"SELECT *\" statement.\nIt applies to DDL as well as DML, including embedded SQL in client code when materialized by a SQL Query object. \n\n\nNot all SELECT * queries are reported in violation, a part of them are ignored:\n- SELECT * FROM a single table in VIEWs / MATERIALIZED VIEWs\n- CREATE TABLE AS SELECT * FROM a single table\n- SELECT * INTO <TABLE_NAME> FROM a single table\n- EXISTS(SELECT *\n- NOT EXISTS(SELECT *\n- SELECT * EXCEPT(...)",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "A query that retrieves all columns of a table with a SELECT * can potentially be the source of important changeability problems. One cannot control how the columns will be ordered and returned to the client. This can lead to important data inconsistencies and thus stability issues.\n\nAlso performance problems may arise when the execution of the query returns a large result sets (many row with all the columns may then become a huge amount of data to transport over the network). Thus optimizer module can't provide a correct execution.",
