Dead Code must be avoided as it makes source code less readable and increases the cost of the software maintenance.\n\nWarning:\nUnreferenced code can also be the symptoms of missing code (code not included in the source code analysis) and / or can be the symptom of use of polymorphism.\nThe intensive use of polymorphism can make the application easier to change but much more difficult to test, debug and stabilize.",
