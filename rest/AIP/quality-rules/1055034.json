    "description": "In a Do-Catch statement, generic Catch blocks (catching any error type) should have code that avoids silently passing the errors.\nThis metric reports all Swift callables (functions, methods, or source codes) with at least one empty (or only containing comments) generic catch block.",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "An empty catch block defeats the purpose of exceptions.\nWhen an exception occurs, nothing happens and the program fails for an unknown reason. The application can be in an unknown state that will affect subsequent processing.\nSince the reason for the issue (the exception type and potential embedded message) are ignored, it will require more time to fix the issue.",
