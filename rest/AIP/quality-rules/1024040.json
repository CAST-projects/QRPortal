This option determines whether the Keystore requires the screen to be unlocked before allowing decryption of any in-flight or stored data using the specified key. These types of keys are well suited for encrypting sensitive data to store on disk, such as health or enterprise data. The flag provides users a higher assurance that the data cannot be decrypted while the device is locked should their phone be lost or stolen.",
