    "rationale": "The effect of accessing a non-static member of a class or a base class in the handler (i.e. the catch part) of a function-try-block of a class constructor/destructor is undefined.\nFor example, if a memory allocation exception is thrown during the creation of the object, the object will not exist when the handler attempts to access its members. Conversely, in the destructor, the object may have been successfully destroyed before the exception is handled, so again will not be available to the handler.\nBy contrast, the lifetime of a static member is greater than that of the object itself, so the static member is guaranteed to exist when the handler accesses it.",
