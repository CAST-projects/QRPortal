    "rationale": "The SQLExec function allows execution of a SQL statement inside PeopleCode and is often used by developers because they only need to copy the query.\nThe SQLExec function has some limitations:\n-limited to 1000 characters\n-possible data corruption because it directly impacts the database\n-the server is queried for each call\n-only get one line\n-SQL code is static. If the table structure change, you need to rewrite it.\n-it doesn't handle the multi-language\n\nImpacts are:\n-performance: it only gets one line if the query contains a join. If the query returns more than one line, only the first one is used but the query execution is for all rows\n-maintenance: during upgrades and maintenance, the SQL string is considered a black box. If field names or table names change during an upgrade, table and field references within the SQL string are not updated automatically. For these reasons, you should use a SQL definition and the meta-SQL statements provided in PeopleTools 8.0 and above.\n-development: the multi-language is not handled by the framework. The join must be written by the developer.",
