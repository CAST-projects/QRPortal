    "description": "The system functions \u201cC_DB_EXECUTE\u201d and \u201cC_DB_FUNCTION\u201d are are used to call for database commands directly.\n\nIn this rule, we are reporting violation when using one of the following function, when their parameter containing the SQL statement is declared with a PARAMETERS statement, as they can be sources of SQL injections: C_DB_EXECUTE or C_DB_FUNCTION",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "By exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can get access to business-critical information or system data. Moreover, a denial of service attack can be performed by executing a complicated SQL statement. For example, a perpetrator can pass a query, which will search for a certain pattern through all the records in the database (via a LIKE statement). This query will take a long time to run and, at the same time, will significantly increase the server load, thus blocking access to the application for legitimate users.",

In ABAP, strings are usually enclosed with backticks (\u2018) and char arrays are usually enclosed in single quotation marks (\u2018). Use different methods of CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG depending on the type of enclosing symbol: use QUOTE_STR with backticks and QUOTE with single quotation marks.",
