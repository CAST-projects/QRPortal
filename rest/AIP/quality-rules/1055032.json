            "description": "Code quality issues are fairly prevalent within most mobile code. The good news is that most code quality issues are fairly benign and result in bad programming practice. It is typically difficult to detect these types of issues through manual code review. Instead, attackers will use third-party tools that perform static analysis or perform fuzzing. These types of tools will typically identify memory leaks, buffer overflows, and other less severe issues that result in bad programming practice. Hackers with extreme low-level knowledge and expertise are able to effectively exploit these types of issues. The typical primary goal is to execute foreign code within the mobile code's address space."
