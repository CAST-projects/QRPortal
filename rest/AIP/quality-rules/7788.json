    "description": "This metric reports all methods with at least one empty catch block (empty or only containing comments).\nIn a Try and Catch statement, Catch blocks should have code to handle the thrown exception. If they are empty or only contain comments, the Exception will not be handled.",
    "output": "This report lists all Artifacts with an empty catch block.\nIt provides the following information:\n- Artifact full name\n- Number of empty catch blocks",
    "rationale": "An empty catch block defeats the purpose of exceptions.\nWhen an exception occurs, nothing happens and the program fails for an unknown reason. The application can be in an unknown state that will affect subsequent processing.\nSince the reason for the issue (the exception type and potential embedded message) are ignored, it will require more time to fix the issue.",

It is typically difficult to detect these types of issues through manual code review. Instead, attackers will use third-party tools that perform static analysis or perform fuzzing. These types of tools will typically identify memory leaks, buffer overflows, and other less severe issues that result in bad programming practice. Hackers with extreme low-level knowledge and expertise are able to effectively exploit these types of issues. The typical primary goal is to execute foreign code within the mobile code's address space."
