    "rationale": "An empty catch block defeats the purpose of exceptions.\nWhen an exception occurs, nothing happens and the program fails for an unknown reason. The application can be in an unknown state that will affect subsequent processing.\nSince the reason for the issue (the exception type and potential embedded message) are ignored, it will require more time to fix the issue.",
