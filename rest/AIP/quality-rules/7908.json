A threshold parameter permit to include getter and setter methods. \n\nNOTE:\n* a method/constructor is considered as unreferenced when it is never called and the method doesn't override a method of a class or doesn't implement a method of an interface.\n* For .net, getter and setter (of properties and indexer) are included\n* For J2EE, getter and setter methods are not included by default because usually these methods are automatically created from IDE and also they can be involved through dynamic mechanism like reflection.",

    "rationale": "Unreferenced code may be the symptom of Dead Code. Dead Code must be avoided as it makes source code less readable and increases the cost of the software maintenance.\n\nWarning:\nUnreferenced code can also be the symptoms of missing code (code not included in the source code analysis) and / or can be the symptom of use of polymorphism.\nThe intensive use of polymorphism can make the application easier to change but much more difficult to test, debug and stabilize.",
