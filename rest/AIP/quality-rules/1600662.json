    "rationale": "SETID is an ID that represents a set of control table information, or TableSets. TableSets enable you to share control table information and processing options among business units. The goal is to minimize redundant data and system maintenance tasks. When you assign a setID to a record group in a business unit, you indicate that all of the tables in the record group are shared between that business unit and any other business unit that also assigns that setID to that record group. For example, you can define a group of common job codes that are shared between several business units. Each business unit that shares the job codes is assigned the same setID for that record group.",
