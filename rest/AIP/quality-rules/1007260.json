    "description": "A command execution vulnerability occurs when user input is embedded unsanitized into a system command. It allows an attacker to terminate the intended command and to append arbitrary system commands for execution. Common character sequences to separate commands are semicolons (;), boolean operators (&|), $(subcommands), `backticks`, and newline characters (%0a).",
