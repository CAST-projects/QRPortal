    "description": "The \u201cDynamic Method Invocation\u201d (DMI) feature has been intoduced in Struts 2 allowing Action to expose other methods instead of execute()\n\nThis feature can lead to security problem because any user of Struts 2 web application can also use DMI to call a public method that is in the Action class.\nIt's, also, possible to pass a malicious expression which can be used to execute arbitrary code on server side when Dynamic Method Invocation is enabled.\n\n\nThis rule will check if DMI is enabled and used for Apache Struts 2.x before 2.3.20.2, 2.3.24.x before 2.3.24.2, and 2.3.28.x before 2.3.28.1.

If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.\n\n\nDMI will use the string following a \u201c!\u201d character in an action name as the name of a method to invoke: A reference to Category!create.action, means using the \u201cCategory\u201d action mapping, but calling 'create' method instead.\n\nAnother way to use DMI is to provide HTTP parameters prefixed with method: in the URL it could be Category.action?method:create=foo, the parameter value is ignored. In POST-Requests that can be used e.g. with a hidden parameter (<s:hidden name=\"method:create\" value=\"foo\" />) or along with a button (<s:submit method=\"create\" />).",
