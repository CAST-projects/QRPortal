    "description": "A violation is raised when a Superclass directly knows about its Subclasses. This happens when a Superclass directly calls a Subclass-method, uses a Subclass-attribute or refers to the name of the Subclass. Currently the rule will only check for references. This rule is compliant with CISQ ASCRM-RLB-14 recommendation.",
    "output": "This report lists line and column of Classes referencing a Subclass.",
    "rationale": "Referencing down the inheritance tree is against Object-Oriented coding practices. It is a way of having two-way inheritance between class and subclass. This is an indication of poor class design and use of class inheritance. Such practices increase the complexity of the application.",
