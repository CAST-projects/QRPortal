    "description": "A violation is raised when a Superclass directly knows about its Subclasses. This happens when a Superclass directly calls a Subclass-method, uses a Subclass-attribute or refers to the name of the Subclass. Currently the rule will only check for references. This rule is compliant with CISQ ASCRM-RLB-14 recommendation.",
