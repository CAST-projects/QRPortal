    "description": "The rule will raise a violation when a comparison check on integers (with one operand as an addition) is done without explicitly defining cast for compared items.",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "Typically when performing integer overflow check the addition is compared with one of the values. The type for added operands automatically get promoted to a higher type and hence a overflow check may be faulty if it is not ensured that the output of the addition in the comparison expression is of the same type as the individual operands, explicitly.\n\nThis becomes security-critical when the result is used to control looping, make a security decision, or determine the offset or size in behaviors such as memory allocation, copying, concatenation, etc.",
