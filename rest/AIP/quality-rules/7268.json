    "rationale": "Because the cleanup code executed at dispose-time is a superset of the code executed at the finalize-time, there is no need to call the finalize-time code during object finalization after the object has been disposed. Moreover, keeping objects that don't need to be finalized in the finalization queue has a cost associated with it. This is why the Dispose() method should call GC.SuppressFinalize, which removes the object from the finalization queue and thus prevents unnecessary finalization.",
