    "description": "This metric reports all methods with at least one empty catch block (empty or only containing comments).\nIn a Try and Catch statement, Catch blocks should have code to handle the thrown exception. If they are empty or only contain comments, the Exception will not be handled.",

    "rationale": "An empty catch block defeats the purpose of exceptions.\nWhen an exception occurs, nothing happens and the program fails for an unknown reason. The application can be in an unknown state that will affect subsequent processing.\nSince the reason for the issue (the exception type and potential embedded message) are ignored, it will require more time to fix the issue.",
