    "description": "This metric retrieves all client-server artifacts that contain an SQL query with a WHERE clause not using the first column of composite index (multiple column base index).\n\nThe value of the metric is number of client-server artifacts that contain an SQL query not using the first column of a composite index divided by the number of client-server artifacts using a composite index.\nAn artifacts using a composite index means here artifacts containing a query that uses at least one column of a compostite index.\n\nXXL tables are extremely large tables which contain a huge amount of data. The threshold that determines when a table is considered to contain a huge amount of data can be configured by the user.",
    "output": "Associated to each artifact with violations, the Quality Rule provides: \n- Name of the table having a misused composite index.",
    "rationale": "Whenever a query with a WHERE clause does not use the first column of composite index (multiple column base index), the database engine will not use the composite index to retrieve the data, potentially leading to very poor performance.",
    "remediation": "Depending on the context, the user has to evaluate if the fact that the composite index is not is leading to poor performance.\nIf the query does not use other indexes, the fact that the query does not use the first column of a composite index is most probably an error that needs to be fixed.",
