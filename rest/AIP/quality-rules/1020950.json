    "description": "Lack of transport encryption allows data to be viewed as it travels over local networks or the internet. Lack of transport encryption is prevalent on local networks as it is easy to assume that local network traffic will not be widely visible, however in the case of a local wireless network, misconfiguration of that wireless network can make traffic visible to anyone within range of that wireless network. Many Issues with transport encryption are easy to discover simply by viewing network traffic and searching for readable data. Automated tools can also look for proper implementation of common transport encryption such as SSL and TLS.",

If no data protection requirements are defined as to what specific data must be encrypted and what data is non-sensitive and doesn't require encryption, all data must be encrypted.\n \nWhen transmitting data, applications need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms, such as TLS, SSL VPNs, or IPSEC.\n\nCommunication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa."
