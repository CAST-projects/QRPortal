    "description": "This rule searches for functions where memory is allocated and the pointed-to data is returned from the function.",
    "output": "Associated to each C function and C++ method with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- pointer allocated in the function or method\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in source code:\n  - pointer dynamic allocation",
    "rationale": "If you allocate memory dynamically, at one time, you will have to deallocate it to avoid memory leaks. If you return the pointed-to data, it means you have not deallocated it within the function. And since you don't return the pointer itself, there will be no way for the function caller to deallocate the memory.",
