    "description": "The implementation of the singleton pattern may not be thread-safe: If several calls were made into this method from a multi-threaded program, you could end up creating multiple instances of the class, and also mess up seriously since the system expects to have only one instance.\n\nThe problem takes place where you check if the instance is null.  \nThis rule reports singleton that initialize the static field that refer to the single instance in a non synchronized method.\n\nA singleton is defined as:\n- a class with a static member with the same type or parent type (extended or implemented) as the class\n- a static method that refers the instance and return an object of same type or a parent type (extended or implemented)\n- a class that has only private constructors",
    "output": "The metric will list all singleton classes that are not thread safe.",
    "rationale": "The code contains a function or method that operates in a multi-threaded environment but owns an unsafe non-final static storable or member data element. This issue can prevent the software from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n\nThe software uses the singleton pattern when creating a resource within a multithreaded environment that may not be thread-safe.",
