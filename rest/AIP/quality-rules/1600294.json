For example, for employee reviews, an employee can be reviewed for performance in multiple categories - organization skills, interpersonal skills, and so on. These categories and ratings are stored in a separate child table, EE_REVIEW_RT, which is directly related to REVIEW_DT, the parent table that stores information about employee reviews.\nThe keys that you establish in a parent record definition determine which keys are required in child record definitions.
