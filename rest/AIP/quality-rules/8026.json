If you need an assignment operator, it's because you need something like a deep copy, or some other management of resources. Thus it is almost certain that you will need a destructor and a copy constructor. \n\nIf you don't need an assignment operator (because the default-generated assignment operator would be correct), you should let the compiler generate it: tt will not contain bugs, and you will often not have to update it when the class is modified.",
