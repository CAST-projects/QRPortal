    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "The use of increment and decrement operators in combination with other operators is not\nrecommended because:\n\u2022 It can significantly impair the readability of the code;\n\u2022 It introduces additional side effects into a statement with the potential for undefined behavior\n\nIt is safer to use these operators in isolation from any other arithmetic operators",
