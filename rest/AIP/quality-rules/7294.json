    "description": "This metric reports all namespaces that have one-on-one and more static circular dependencies.\nDependencies mean:\n - references through static methods call\n - references through class fields\n - references through inheritance\n\nNote that all these links are static links and not runtime.\nThe threshold parameter permit to define the maximal number of namespaces to cross for a cycle.\n\nNote that cycle notion means here a directed path in a graph that is directed by dependencies relations.",
    "output": "This report lists all namespaces with static cyclical call to or inheritance with another .NET namespace.\nIt provides the following information:\n  * namespace full name \n  * cyclically called / inherited namespace full name",
    "rationale": "When two namespaces refer to each other through a call, the result is a circular dependency. Neither namespaces can function without the other, and so neither is reusable without the other. In some cases, a redesign may eliminate these dependencies. When circular references are necessary, redesign it to ensure reusability. The same problem happens when some classes from a namespace A inherit from classes of a namespace B and other classes from namespace B inherit from other classes from namespace A. This rule can be extended to circular dependencies for more than 2 namespaces (for example a namespace A call a namespace B that call a namespace C, that call namespace A).",
