    "description": "This metric reports all namespaces that have one-on-one and more static circular dependencies.\nDependencies mean:\n - references through static methods call\n - references through class fields\n - references through inheritance\n\nNote that all these links are static links and not runtime.\nThe threshold parameter permit to define the maximal number of namespaces to cross for a cycle.\n\nNote that cycle notion means here a directed path in a graph that is directed by dependencies relations.",
    "output": "This report lists all namespaces with static cyclical call to or inheritance with another .NET namespace.\nIt provides the following information:\n  * namespace full name \n  * cyclically called / inherited namespace full name",
    "rationale": "When two namespaces refer to each other through a call, the result is a circular dependency. Neither namespaces can function without the other, and so neither is reusable without the other. In some cases redesign may eliminate these dependencies. When circular references are necessary, redesign it to ensure reusability. The same problem happen when some classes from a namespace A inherit from classes of a namespace B and other classes from namespace B inherit from other classes from namespace A. This rule can be extended to circular dependencies for more than 2 namespaces (for example a namespace A call a namespace B that call a namespace C, that call namespace A).",
