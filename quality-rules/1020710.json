The end user\u2019s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page. This rule is compliant with CISQ OMG ASCSM-CWE-079 recommendation and OWASP 2013 and 2017 A5 - Security Misconfiguration.",
