The threshold that determines when a table is considered to contain a huge amount of data can be configured by the user.",

    "rationale": "Non-indexed SQL Queries are potentially performance killers.\nIndeed, each execution of the query will result in a full table scan which is extremely time consuming especially if the table contains an extremely large amount of data (XXL table).",
