    "description": "This rule retrieves all ABAP artifacts using SELECT ... ENDSELECT statement on tables and views. This rule applies only XXL database tables. Loops using the addition UP TO 1 ROWS (or UP TO ONE ROWS) are not considered as violations.\n\nXXL tables are extremely large tables which contain a huge amount of data. The threshold that determines when a table is considered to contain a huge amount of data can be configured by the user.",
    "output": "Associated to each ABAP Artifact with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The XXL SAP Table/View name",
    "rationale": "The SELECT ... ENDSELECT works as a loop fetching single record for every loop pause. Basically, it works like a client cursor which will generate too much traffic on the network and communications between the application server and the database server. When used on extremely large tables, this statement becomes a performance killer.",
