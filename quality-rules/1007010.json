    "description": "This rule searches for all Script Functions with High Fan-Out. \n         The Fan-out of Script Function is the number of other artifacts that are referencing in it. \n         When computing the Fan-Out of an artifact, multiple accesses to the same component of an artifact are counted as one access.\n         The threshold is a parameter and can be changed as per requirement.",
    "output": "This report lists all Script Functions with a High Fan-Out.\n      \nThis QR provides the following information:\nScript Function full name.",
    "rationale": "If an artifact is referencing large number of artificats, maintenance and evolution becomes difficult. This is because all the referenced artifacts need to be updated and\\or retested.",
