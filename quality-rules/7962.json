For example:\ng(){myException()}\n f() {\n       while { g ()}\n        g()\n        } \n\nwill report both path to g() while only one is a violation.\n\n2/ 2/ Several paths for the same method violating the rule are identified in the Metric Detail page by a sequence ID (in the Value column), this ID is dynamically set during each snapshot and the same path can have a different sequence ID in different snapshots.",
