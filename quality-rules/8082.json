    "rationale": "In relational database design, a candidate key is just a unique identifier.  Next a primary key is a candidate key that's been singled out  to uniquely identify each row in a table. \nA unique key or primary key comprises a single column or set of columns. No two distinct rows in a table can have the same value (or combination of values) in those columns. \n\nDepending on its design, a table may have arbitrarily many unique keys but at most one primary key.\n\n=> Primary keys are defined in the ANSI SQL Standard, through the PRIMARY KEY constraint.",
