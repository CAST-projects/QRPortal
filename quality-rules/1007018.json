Cyclomatic Complexity computes the\nnumber of linearly independent paths and a lower boundary of all execution paths ignoring multiple iterations.\n\nChangeability declines with increasing Cyclomatic Complexity.\nComplete testing requires\ncoverage of all execution paths. Cyclomatic Complexity computes the number of linearly independent paths\nand a lower boundary of all execution paths ignoring multiple iterations.\nTestability declines\nwith increasing Cyclomatic Complexity.",
