With NSURLCredentialPersistenceSynchronizable attribute the distribution of the credential and its storage will be in the Apple's cloud environment. Depending upon the privacy requirements of the application, storing the credential in the Apple cloud environment may not be acceptable.. This rule is compliant with OWASP M2 2016.",
