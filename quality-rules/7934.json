    "description": "A Superclass or interface is not allowed to have knowledge of any of its subclasses or Interfaces. The Superclass (or Interface) has knowledge of the Subclass (or Interface) if the Superclass (or Super-interface) directly calls a Subclass-method, uses a Subclass-attribute or refers to the name of the Subclass (or reference the subinterface).",

    "rationale": "Referencing down the inheritance tree is against Object-Oriented coding practices. It is a way of having two-way inheritance between class (or interface) and subclass (or subinterface). This is an indication of poor class (or interface) design and class (or interface) inheritance. Such practices increase the complexity of the application.",
