    "output": "Associated to each COBOL Program with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The number of OPEN statements\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in source code:\n  - OPEN statement",
    "rationale": "Use a single OPEN statement rather than separate OPEN statements for files opened by a program. Use of a single OPEN statement reduces routine loading time. System routines required for OPEN are referenced once for each OPEN statement regardless of the number of files specified in the statement.",
