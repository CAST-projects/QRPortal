    "rationale": "The SELECT ... ENDSELECT works as a loop fetching single record for every loop pause. Basically, it works like a client cursor which will generate to much traffic on the network and communications between the application server and the database server. Having nested  SELECT ... ENDSELECT is equivalent to have an SQL query  inside a loops which number of iterations is based on the number of rows returned by the SQL query. Having a such a nested statement means having an SQL query inside a loop which number of iterations can be very high (dependent on the data returned from the database).\nThis iterative pattern has proved to be dangerous for application performance and scalability. Database servers handle in a much better set-oriented pattern rather than pure iterative ones.\nLoad data in internal tables instead.",
