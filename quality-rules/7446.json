    "description": "For JSE 4.x and previous version, all methods that are not synchronized and that check a value of one of its field before using synchronized and then check this field again and then assign a value to this field will be reported.",
    "output": "This report lists all Methods that use double checked locking pattern.\nIt provides the following information:\n Method full name",
    "rationale": "Double checked locking is a software design pattern used to reduce locking overhead when implementing lazy initialization in a multi-thread environment. This avoid to initializing a value until the first time it is accessed.\nThis pattern is unsafe because there is no guarantee it will work on single or multi-processor machines.\nNote also that even if this issue as been fixed in JSE 5.0 it doesn't provide performance optimization.",

    "remediation": "To remediate, there are two solutions depending on performance choice:\n1/ synchronize the method: each call to this method will cost but the initialization will be made when needed\n2/ make the field static  (Initialize-On-Demand Holder Class idiom): the field will be initialized during the initialization of the class even if not required, but each call to the method that return this field will not cost.",
