    "description": "This rule searches for class members that are not declared as Private. The following situations are excluded from the list of violations:\n- Protected members belonging to a class having sub-classes\n- Public members declared with the addition READ-ONLY\n- Constants",

    "rationale": "This is one of the main benefit and principle of Object-Oriented design and coding: Encapsulation. If direct access to object members is allowed through Public members, there is a significant increase of the cost and risk of changes as well as an increase of security risks. However, a public member can be flagged with the READ-ONLY attribute in order to avoid external modification.",
