For example, an \r\nartifact that contains an IF statement which contains a While loop which itself contains another IF statement will have a Depth of Code of 3 (at least).\r\nAvoid Artifacts with Depth of Code (DoC) greater than X. \r\nThe threshold level is a parameter that can be changed at will.",
