    "description": "The IOSTAT usage in a read, write or open operation are causing the analysis to create specific variables where the return code is stored in. Whenever this variable is not used in any IF construct , the artifact is reported as a violation. The proper order in which this needs to take place is not taken into account; only the artifacts that have no testing of IOSTAT variables are captured by this diagnostic.",
    "rationale": "The variable that contains the IOSTAT return code value must be tested to ensure properly handling of any errors in the read/write that may have occurred. Dont assume that the operation is successful.",
    "reference": "IOSTAT= ios  is an input/output status specifier that specifies the status of the input/output operation. ios is a scalar variable. When the input/output statement containing this specifier finishes execution, ios is defined with: A zero value if no error condition occurs. A positive value if an error occurs.",
    "remediation": "Make sure that all variables containing the return code value for a read, write or open opetation are actually tested to make sure the these operations are successful or not.",
