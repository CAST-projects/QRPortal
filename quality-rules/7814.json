    "description": "This diag is a clone of the old diag called \"Avoid tables not involved in a Foreign key\" listing all tables not involved in a Foreign Key (FK). \nThe use of Foreign Keys between Tables must be applied to manage referential integrity only.",
    "output": "This report lists all tables not involved in a Foreign Key \n\nIt provides the following information:  \n\n- Table name",
    "rationale": "A foreign key is an integral part of a relational database design and contributes to the database's consistency. The use of Foreign Keys between Tables must be applied to manage referential integrity only. \nWhen one table has a foreign key to another table, the concept of referential integrity states that you may not add a record to the table that contains the foreign key unless there is a corresponding record in the linked table. It also includes the techniques known as cascading update and cascading delete, which ensure that changes made to the linked table are reflected in the primary table. This avoids redundant data entry and thus maintains data integrity.",
