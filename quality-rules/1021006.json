This rule will check the official Python requests syntax, to do call to web service. This rule is compliant with CISQ OMG ASCPEM-PRF-08 recommendation.",

By minimizing the number of calls, you improve application speed, reduce communications overhead (why send three request when you can do it by one), and reduce network traffic.",
