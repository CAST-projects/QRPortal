    "description": "Depth of Code is measured as the maximum number of nested control statements in an artifact. For example, an \nArtifact that contains an IF statement which contains a While loop which itself contains another IF statement will have a Depth of Code of 3 (at least).\nAvoid Artifacts with Depth of Code (DoC) greater than X. The threshold level is a parameter that can be changed at will.",
