    "description": "This rule searches for C++ methods redeclaring and overriding methods that assign different default parameter values. \n\nNote: the same parameters expressed differently (such as 2 +2 instead of 4) are considered as different.",
    "output": "Associated to each C++ method with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The name of the overridden method\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in the source code:\n  - Overridden method",
    "rationale": "An overridden virtual method should have the same default values as the base class method. Default parameter values are determined by the static type of the object on which the method call is done. This means that the default values used may not match those of the virtual method being called. For non virtual methods, this makes the code more complex to understand.",
    "reference": "Effective C++, Item 38;",
    "remediation": "Check the parameter default value and try to align them with those that are defined in the overridden method.",
    "remediationSample": "class Base \n{ \n public: \n  virtual void myfct( int a = 0 ); \n}; \n\nclass Derived : public Base \n{ \n public: \n  virtual void myfct( int a = 0 );  // FIXED\n};",
