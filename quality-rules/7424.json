    "description": "This metric retrieves all artifacts using at least one SQL query inside a loop statement.",
    "output": "Associated to each client-server artifact with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- Number of violation patterns\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in the source code:\n  - SQL query\n  - loop starting line",
    "rationale": "Having an SQL query inside a loop is usually the source of performance and scalability problems especially if the number of iterations become very high (for example if it is dependent on the data returned from the database).\nThis iterative pattern has proved to be very dangerous for application performance and scalability. Database servers perform much better in set-oriented patterns rather than pure iterative ones.",
    "remediation": "The remediation is often to replace the iterative approach based on a loop with a set-oriented one and thus modify the query.",
