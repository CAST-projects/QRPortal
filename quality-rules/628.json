    "associatedValueName": "Virtual class method invoked",
    "description": "This rule searches for virtual functions of a class called from within the constructor or destructor of this class.",
    "output": "Associated to each C++ Constructor/Destructor with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- Virtual member function name\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in the source code:\n  - Virtual member function call",
    "rationale": "Invoking virtual functions in a constructor/destructor always invokes the function for the class under construction/destruction, even when the constructor is invoked as part of the construction of a derived Class. This behavior is not often what was expected.",

    "remediation": "If you want virtual function call behavior at construction time, it must be done post construction. Several idioms exist to help you do that, however none of them are perfect (\"C++ coding standards\":http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c++cs.htm details some options).",
