    "rationale": "When using a framework such as the PFC, controls must not inherit from the standard PowerBuilder controls but should, instead inherit from the userobjects provided by the framework. The framework userobjects usually embed common behavior which will be missing if the control does comply with the rule. The consequence of the non-compliance to this rule is that the application will be more difficult to change and can be less robust depending on how important the missing behavior is.",
