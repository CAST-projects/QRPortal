    "description": "This rule searches for all Functions and Methods with High Fan-In.\n         The Fan-in of Method or Function is the number of other artifacts that are referencing it.\n         When computing the Fan-In of an artifact, multiple accesses to it from the same artifact are counted as one access. \n         The threshold is a parameter and can be changed as per requirement.",
