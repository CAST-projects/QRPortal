If server trust evaluation is failing, you must understand why it's failing and decide on the best way to resolve that failure. It is not a public API and is thus not supported by Apple; moreover, use of non-public APIs is not allowed in App Store apps. This rule is compliant with  OWASP M3 2016.",
