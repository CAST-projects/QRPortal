    "description": "Strings are a common form of input. Because many string-handling functions have no built-in checks for string length, strings are frequently the source of exploitable buffer overflows. This rule is compliant with CISQ OMG ASCSM-CWE-134, ASCSM-CWE-120, ASCRM-CWE-120 recommendations and with OWASP 2016 M7 recommendation.",
