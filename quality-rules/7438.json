    "description": "All singleton that initialize the static field that refer to the single instance in a non synchronized method will be reported. \n\nA singleton is defined as:\n- a class with a static member with the same type or parent type (extended or implemented) as the class\n- a static method that refers the instance and return an object of same type or a parent type (extended or implemented)\n- a class that has only private constructors",
    "output": "The metric will list all singleton classes that are not thread safe.",
    "rationale": "If singleton is invoked in a multi-threaded program, you could end up creating multiple instances of the class which will make the application instable.",

    "remediation": "To remediate to this issue (in case of multi-threaded environment), there is two solutions:\n1/ declare the field that hold the unique instance as static final and initialize it in the declaration\n2/ synchronize the method that initialize the field",
