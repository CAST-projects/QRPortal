    "rationale": "How you define numeric fields can have an impact on performance. If you are using a field for arithmetic increment or as a subscript \nand the field has 8 or fewer digits it is quite often best to define it as a binary number (usage is BINARY, COMP or COMP-4) \nthat is signed. This is because binary numbers can be manipulated much faster and consume less CPU.",
