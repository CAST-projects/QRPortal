If they are empty or only contain comments, the Exception will not be handled.",

    "rationale": "An empty catch block defeats the purpose of exceptions.\nWhen an exception occurs, nothing happens and the program fails for an unknown reason. The application can be in an unknown state that will affect subsequent processing.\nSince the reason for the issue (the type of the exception and potential embedded message) are not known, it will require more time to fix the issue.",
