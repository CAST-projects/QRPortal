    "description": "Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) gives you a lot of security benefits for little coding overhead. It will be much harder to take an SCE disabled application and either secure it on your own or enable SCE at a later stage. This rule is compliant with CISQ OMG ASCSM-CWE-079 recommendation and OWASP 2013 A3 recommendation.",
    "output": "Line and column for each violation \nAssociated value => number of violations found",
    "rationale": "To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that context. It helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.",
