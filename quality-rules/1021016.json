    "description": "MD5 hashes were used as salt to hash a password or a passphrase. In cryptography, a salt is random data that's used as additional input to a one-way function. Recently, several exploits were developed which proved that MD5 will generate identical outputs for the different input parameters. As a consequence, somebody can break your encryption or log on to your website. This rule is compliant with CISQ OMG ASCSM-CWE-327 recommendation.",
    "output": "Line and column for each violation\nAssociated value => number of violations found",
    "rationale": "The use of a non-standard algorithm is dangerous because a determined attacker may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected. Well-known techniques may exist to break the algorithm.",
    "remediation": "Avoid using MD5 hashes as input to cryptographic functions or to store passwords. Python offers the following hashing algorithms: SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512. Make sure you choose the most appropriate one, depending on your use case, security requirements and runtime constraints.",
