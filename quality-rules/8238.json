    "description": "The product mixes trusted and untrusted data in the same data structure or structured message. \n\nThe list of user input methods can be customized as well as the output method and the sanitization methods.",
    "output": "List all methods that miss calling the required sanitization method and provides access to the path demonstrating the vulnerability : \n  \nIt provides the following information: \n- The full name of the method that calls the user input method. That is the source of the untrusted data. \n- Call stack from user input source down to the target method.",
