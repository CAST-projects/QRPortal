If an injected class is not proxyable, the container will raise an exception at runtime. \n\nThis error will not be detected at compilation. \n\nAs per the CDI specs, A class can be put in a proxy if it fulfills the following constraints: \n* It must have a non private Constructor with no argument, \n* It must neither be final nor have a final method. \n\nThe normal scopes are Session, RequestScope, Conversation and Application, and any custom scope annotated as normal.
