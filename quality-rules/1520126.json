    "description": "When two or more BusComp fields are mapped to the same table column, it can lead to the following problems:\n* If both fields are active in the same BusComp context, it can lead to duplicate column insert errors during an insert or copy operation.  This behavior occurs most frequently during a copy.\n* It adds to repository overhead and introduces maintenance difficulties.",
