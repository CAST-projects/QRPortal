    "description": "Reports all objects that reference the following java.sql interface and their methods\n- java.sql.Connection\n- java.sql.Statement\n- java.sql.PreparedStatement\n- java.sql.CallableStatement\nexcept when they are used as parameters of hibernate methods (methods whose FQDN begin with net.sf.hibernate or org.hibernate)\n\nThe threshold permits to add other interfaces or classes from other framework to the previous list.",
    "output": "List objects that use other API than hibernate API\nIt provides the following information:\n - Artifact Full Name\n - Number of reference",
    "rationale": "Using Hibernate API only brings several benefits:\n- Performances: Hibernate provides potential for caching that is expected to outperforms queries that use direct JDBC access.\n- Implementation: object mapping takes care of mapping the JDBC result sets to graph of persistent objects. Using direct JDBC API means writing the tedious code by hand to transform a JDBC ResultSet to an object graph.\n- Database independence: the code can be used with all supported databases\n- Transparent support of JDBC and JTA in both managed and non-managed environments",
