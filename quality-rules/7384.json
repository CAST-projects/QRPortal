    "description": "This rule searches for Cobol programs calling large subprograms statically.",
    "output": "Associated to each COBOL Program with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The subprogram name\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in source code:\n  - CALL statement",
    "rationale": "A subprogram can be called statically or dynamically. A static call uses a literal to specify the target whereas a dynamic call uses a variable. In the first case, the main program and the subprogram are compiled and linked into one load module. In the second case, the main program and the subprogram are compiled separately and the load module will not contain the subprogram code. They will be linked at the execution time when the main program will call the subprogram.\n\nSo for performance and memory aspects, it is better to call large subprograms dynamically in order to avoid having a large load module.",
