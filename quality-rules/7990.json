    "output": "Associated to each C/C++ function/method/constructor/destructor with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- Number of violation patterns\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in the source code:\n  - 'realpath()' function call",
    "rationale": "The function 'realpath()' is considered as very risky and must not be used since it is not possible to specify correctly the size for the output buffer. Using PATH_MAX constant or 'pathconf()' function may also lead to troubles because PATH_MAX can be undefined and, according to POSIX, 'pathconf()' can be too large to be used to allocate memory correctly and can return -1 if PATH_MAX is not bounded.",

    "remediation": "Try to avoid using the 'realpath()' function. If it is not possible, then protect the code against buffer overflow and check if the possible max path size is compliant with the MAX_PATH constant.",
