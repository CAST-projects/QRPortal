    "rationale": "ANSI syntax allow a clear separation between joins clause and the where clause restrictions.  The ANSI notation makes the relations between the tables explicit, and saves you from coding equality tests for join conditions in the WHERE clause. \nThus the mix of both join notations makes the readability & maintainability of the code more complex. Moreover ANSI joins allows having optimization hints. And last, this historic syntax notation will probably be deprecated in a future release",
