    "rationale": "Cobol 85 allows using dedicated statement terminators. For maintainability aspect, it is better to use the END-EVALUATE terminator than a simple period. If there is not an END-EVALUATE terminator in the EVALUATE sentence then the first period ends it (and not only the statement) and it is difficult to understand where is the trouble.",
