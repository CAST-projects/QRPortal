    "rationale": "There are two benefits to use PreparedStatement or CallableStatement over Statement:\n- Performance: PreparedStatement gives better performance when compared to Statement because it is pre-parsed. CallableStatement is even more efficient but as it uses a stored procedure in the database, it is less portable,\n- Security: to prevent SQL Injection Attacks.",
