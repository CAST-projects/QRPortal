    "output": "This report lists all the Methods, Functions and PHP Sections containing strings with double quotes and without any variable.\nThis QR provides the following information:\nMethods, Functions and PHP Sections full name.",
    "rationale": "For the strings using double quotes PHP do some extra processing in order to detect if the string contains any variables.So in this case, echo \u2018This is long string\u2019 . $name is faster then echo \u201cThis is long string $name\u201d. Concatenation with single quotes is faster and   for example for echo \u2018This is long string\u2019 , $name, is faster because it does not require any string manipulation.So always prefer single quotes for the strings if you do not use variable in your string.",
