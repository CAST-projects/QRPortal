    "description": "Most of the time the import statements should be as specific as possible and you should only import what is needed. When from module import * is used, you are implicitly loading all locals of the imported module into and over the importing module. This has two disadvantages: first, you might unintentionally overload already imported objects. Second, it becomes difficult to detect undefined names in the program that imported the module. This rule is compliant with the CISQ OMG ASCMM-MNT-20 recommendation.",
