    "description": "This rule searches for all JavaScript Functions with High Fan-In.\n         The Fan-in of JavaScript Function is the number of other Artifacts that are referencing it.\n         When computing the Fan-In of an Artifact, multiple accesses to it from the same Artifact are counted as one access. \n         The threshold is a parameter and can be changed as per requirement.",
    "output": "This report lists all JavaScript Functions with a High Fan-In.\n               \nThis QR provides the following information:\nJavaScript Function full name.",
    "rationale": "If an artifact is referenced by large number of artifacts, maintenance and evolution becomes difficult. This is because all the referencing artifacts need to be updated and\\or retested.",
