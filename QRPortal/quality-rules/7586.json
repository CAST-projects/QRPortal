    "description": "This report shows ABAP Event Methods that are handled by an Abap Event and that activate this Abap Event, directly or indirectly by calling other Abap Methods. A cycle can be created by :\n- a sequence based on an Abap Event calling an Abap Event Method calling this Abap Event\n- a sequence based on an Abap Event calling an Abap Event Method calling an Abap Method calling the same Abap Event (the maximum number of Abap Methods is set to 2)\n- several sequences of Abap Event E1 calling . . . Abap Event E2",
