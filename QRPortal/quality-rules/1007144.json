    "rationale": "The number of weighted methods of a class is a good indicator of how much time and effort is required to modify and maintain this class. A class with a large number of methods also means that this class has a greater potential impact on derived classes and therefore the cost to maintain and test it is also high.\n\nA large number of methods also means that this class has a greater potential impact on derived classes.\n\n\nA class is violating the rules when having more than 50 weighted methods",
