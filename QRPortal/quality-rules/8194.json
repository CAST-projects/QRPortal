    "description": "This rule searches for C++ methods that override another method without respecting the 'const' or 'volatile' qualifiers or name is sslight differences when compared with base class method",
    "output": "Associated to each C++ method with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- number of const or volatile qualifiers that are not respected or name is slight differences when compared with base class method\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in source code:\n  - overridden method\n  - overriding method",
    "rationale": "For a function to be picked as an override of a function in a base class, both functions must match exactly - same name, same parameters and same const/volatile qualification. If the functions only differ by the qualification, they will be seen as totally non correlated functions, and the base function will not be considered as overridden.\n\nC++11: If you use the 'override' keyword, you will not risk a function in a derived class not matching the version in the base class.",
    "remediation": "If the base class function must be overridden, then respect all its properties in the derived class. Otherwise, use a name that is different for the function of the derived class.",
    "sample": "class A\n{\npublic:\n    virtual ~A();\n    virtual void f() const;\n};\n\nclass B : public A\n{\npublic:\n    virtual void f(); // Violation\n};",
