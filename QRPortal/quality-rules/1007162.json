    "rationale": "In PHP when a string variable is given as a string value parameter, the string\nwill be evaluated to the value of the variable. The result will be a string that holds the string representation\nof the value. This practice could provoke unexpected results to be used as a given parameter. Usually\nthe intention would be to pass the raw value of the variable instead of the string-representation.\nThe\nsame type of unexpected results are also obtained when the strings are created as follows:\n\n- .$variable\n    - \"\"{$variable}\"\"\n    - $variable.\"\"\"\"\n\n    - \"\"\"\".$variable.\"\"\"\"\"",
