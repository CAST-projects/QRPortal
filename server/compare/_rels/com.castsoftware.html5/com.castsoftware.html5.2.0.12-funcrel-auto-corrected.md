## Note about fixed issue HTMLVJS-545

The correction of HTMLVJS-545 will have a significant impact on analysis results:
- Many new links may be resolved
- New functions can appear.
- Some previously incorrect links will be removed for code where prefix of function calls are between parentheses (see example below). Before correction, there was a call link to a split function if such a function existed in code because the parenthesised expression was not seen.

- Some evaluations have been improved due to better resolution of this type of code (see example below). Before correction, "hcall()" was not replaced with "\{\}".
