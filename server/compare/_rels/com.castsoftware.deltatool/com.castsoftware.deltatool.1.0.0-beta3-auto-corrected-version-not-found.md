# 1.0.0-beta3

## Updates

To simplify the report, the following changes are implemented in this release:
- In the analysis report, there are 2 columns "Delta" & "Delta max ID". The column "Delta max ID" is an internal computation to investigate the added and deleted objects. To simplify the report, the column "Delta max ID"  is removed and new hidden sheets are created to have the report for max ID.

- The report is modified to adopt to the new version of AIP. If the data is not available in any version of AIP, the report will not be displayed.
