# 2.2.0-beta1

- Corrects some links to Java
- Removes improper warnings when using other analyzers
- Added a discoverer which is materialized through an option in the CAST Delivery Manager Tool called "**BPEL project**" located in the **Projects to discover** section. Note that:

*   this option will be disabled (unticked) in all pre-existing packages - you need to tick it before starting the packaging process otherwise it will be ignored.
*   for new packages created after the extension's installation, the option will be enabled by default
