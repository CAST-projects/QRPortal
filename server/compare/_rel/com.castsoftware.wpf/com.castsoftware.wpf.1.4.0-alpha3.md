## Resolved issues

| Internal ID | Call ID | Description |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------- |
| APLWPF-13 |  | None of the links have bookmarks from the links for WPF. |
| APLWPF-50 | - | Binding Links should be handled correctly when we have same Property name in different classes. Binding links now take the full object name (i.e. object path)Â into account instead of just the object name. |
| APLWPF-128 | - | Handled exceptions of the type 'list index out of range'. |
| APLWPF-151 | - | Exception thrown if xaml file has commented code |
