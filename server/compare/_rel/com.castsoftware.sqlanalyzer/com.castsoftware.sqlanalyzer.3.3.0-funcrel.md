# 3.3.0-funcrel

## Updates

- _Data export like_ files are no more analyzed. A data export like file is a DML file having more then 80% of INSERT ... VALUES () statements from the total number of DML statements. You'll see from now this kind of message in analysis log:

This file `<FILE\_NAME>` is considered as data export and it will not be analyzed because, from the total number of DML statements, <XX.XX>% are INSERT ... VALUES ().
- Database subset is now supported by SQL Analyzer (SQLSCRIPT-538, call id 18319). There is no specific database project. Here is how it works, for the 3 CAST-MSÂ existing options:

*   **Inactive**: no database subset
*   **Interface**: only objects linked directly with the application client code are considered internals, all others are considered externals.
*   **Full**: objects linked directly with the application client code and also all SQL objects called by the first list of objects, recursively, are considered internals, all others are considered externals.
