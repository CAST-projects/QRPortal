- New support for the relocation tag in *.pom: previously the CAST Delivery Manager Tool (DMT) was not able to access and extract artifacts defined in relocation tags even if the artifactID or groupID was specified in the DMT interface. relocation tags are now supported.
- When a versionID is specified for an artifact in the CAST Delivery Manager Tool (DMT) interface, the DMT will attempt to extract the exact version. If then a pom.xml cannot be found, the DMT will attempt to obtain the best version from the maven-metadata.xml of the specified artifact. If a best version is available, the DMT will then attempt to extract it.
